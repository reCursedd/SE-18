github only tracks statistics for who makes a commit to a project.

Assumption: only code (er, and documentation...) contributions matter

What about other types of contributors?
 - Bug reporters who identify issues but don't submit the code to fix them?
 - Code reviewers who point out issues in pull requests?
 - Maintainers who merge PRs?
 - Release managers who test and tag releases?
 - Community managers (or reviewer suggestion bots!) that tag people to review pull requests? (Connectors)
