Does saying "thanks", "thank you", or "thx" have an impact on whether new contributors come back?
 - Not for whether they come back once
 - What about whether they become an "above average" committer?

Step 2: What about issue reporters?
Step 3: What about for users that are completely new to participating on github?

# servo/servo

The servo community was/is using a separate website to review pull requests.
It's called "Critic", so I've excluded any comments by community members
telling people to go look at Critic.
