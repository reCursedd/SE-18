When I did the initial (incorrect) implementation, I used a list input as well, but then problem with a list is that defining the gradient of the regularizer is a bit weird. I think we should force the input to pack the weights into one higher rank tensor. We can unpack them within the <code>lp_path_regularizer</code>. This way, we can define the gradient with respect to a single, tensor input.</p>", "body_text": "@alisidd makes sense.
