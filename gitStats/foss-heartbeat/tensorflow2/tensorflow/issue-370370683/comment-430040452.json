There is a lot of overlap since the parquet-cpp reader is based on Arrow. I believe that the parquet-cpp reader can produce Arrow record batches that could then leverage the base classes here that iterate over the batches. It would be nice to have a common Arrow layer in TensorFlow Dataset that is easy to extend for specific Ops.
