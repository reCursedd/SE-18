I would recommend if you are\ntrying to use cuda, making sure that it is the appropriate version for your\ngraphics card.  I have an nvidia 720 with Ubuntu 14, and had cuda 6.5\noperational, but when I tried to use cuda 8 all these problems popped up.\nCheck cuda docs and read very thoroughly about their recommended specs for\nyour gpu.  Also make sure you are removing the newer version of cuda before\nreplacing it with the older.
