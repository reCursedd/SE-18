I've found workaround for the issue as stated adding cc_binary inside test/BUILD works. Now I am trying to generate executable for hexagon. I see that someone has already tried that at Google. I replaced the triple and data format in cpu_compiler.cc. Still it's generating x86 executable. Ideally it should pick up the appropriate platform based on triple isn't it? I've added appropriate additions in BUILD files of llvm/BUILD and cpu/BUILD. It's building successfully. But the binary generated isn't hexagon compatible.</p>", "body_text": "@aselle Thanks!
