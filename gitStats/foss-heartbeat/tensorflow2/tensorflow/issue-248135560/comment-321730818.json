I have a TF build \"in my hand\" that is patched together but is CUDA 9RC and cuDNN 7.0 and I want to see if anyone is interesting in trying it.  I also need to make sure there is not some weird reason why I cannot share it.  There are changes that need to be made to some upstream libraries that TensorFlow uses but you will start to see PRs coming in from NVIDIA in the near future.  I and the team were able to test CUDA 8 + cuDNN 6 on Volta and then CUDA 9RC + cuDNN 7 on Volta (V100) with FP32 code.  I only do Linux builds and Python 2.7 but if all/any of you are interested I would like to try and involve the community more than we did with cuDNN 6.0.  It might not be super fun but I want to offer as well as try to make this feel more like we are in this together vs. I am feeing information.  I also still want to build out lists of what features we are working on but not promising for cuDNN 7 (and 6.0).  <a class=\"user-mention\" data-hovercard-type=\"user\" data-hovercard-url=\"/hovercards?user_id=51059\" data-octo-click=\"hovercard-link-click\" data-octo-dimensions=\"link_type:self\" href=\"https://github.com/cancan101\">@cancan101</a>  thank you for the full list.</p>", "body_text": "Alright I am thinking about starting a new issue that is more of a \"blog\" of CUDA 9 RC + cuDNN 7.0.
