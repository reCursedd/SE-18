I am personally just starting to\nfully test cuDNN 6 (Internally it has been tested a lot but I have not been\nusing it personally).  I am often slow to upgrade to the latest stuff.  My\nguess is you may not see any real change with cuDNN 7 until everything gets\npatched to use the latest APIs.  I want to stress again that I am wrong all\nof the time.  What I have seen as an outsider is the new cuDNN versions add\nnew methods/APIs.  Some are interesting and some are not immediately\nuseful.  Then those APIs get exposed via the TensorFlow API or just used\nbehind the scenes to make existing methods faster.  My very high level\nunderstanding is cuDNN 7 + CUDA 9 will enhance FP16 support with a focus on\nVolta.  I think one of the main focuses is how to get models (many not just\na few) to converge with FP16 without having to endlessly guess the right\nconfig/hyperparameters to use.
