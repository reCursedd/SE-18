Just a question - what do you think about <code>return_docs_len</code> to be argument of the <code>VocabularyProcessor</code> constructor? As I would expect that if <code>fit</code> returns then <code>transform</code> should return as well. Also how are you passing this (x, doc_length) into Estimator? Probably quick example would be great.</p>\n<p><a class=\"user-mention\" data-hovercard-type=\"user\" data-hovercard-url=\"/hovercards?user_id=577277\" data-octo-click=\"hovercard-link-click\" data-octo-dimensions=\"link_type:self\" href=\"https://github.com/martinwicke\">@martinwicke</a> Yes, there is no real alternative (even after we get feature_to_id op, we still need vocabulary generator).</p>", "body_text": "@abhitopia Thanks for the contribution.
