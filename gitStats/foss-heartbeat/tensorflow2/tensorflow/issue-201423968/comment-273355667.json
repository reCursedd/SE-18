From what Martin told me, the current issue is that pypi has a limitation on the size of the pips, and adding those two compute capabilities will probably bloat the size of the GPU pip wheel to something too large.  So I wish I could say this is trivial to change, but it might require some more work on the pip/pypi side first.</p>", "body_text": "Thanks @cliffwoolley, very helpful!
