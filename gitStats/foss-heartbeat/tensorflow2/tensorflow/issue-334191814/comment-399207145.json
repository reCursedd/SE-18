This patch fixes a slightly lax OOB check against <code>CpuAotCompilationResult</code> which is generated data concerning temp buffer sizes. Looking at <code>//tensorflow/compiler/aot/codegen_test.cc</code>, there seems to be a manually crafted <code>CpuAotCompilationResult</code> for the golden example (that's expected to be accepted), but no existing test for \"badly\" crafted ones as far as I can see. Let me know how you want to proceed. Thanks!</p>", "body_text": "@qlzh727 Do you really want a new test just for this change?
