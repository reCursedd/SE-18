I've used a simple while loop to perform an inference whenever a character is entered from stdin, to demonstrate the memory being used not released while the application is still running.\nThis code is used for inference against a trained version of Object Detection model architecture found here.  I've prepared a custom dataset and performed training similar to the Quick Start guide for Training a Pet Detector.

In the process of debugging, I've attached the VisualVM profiler and a remote Java debugger to step through code execution.  Additionally, I've been using `htop` to monitor the memory usage from active processes running on the server hosting the API.  \r\n\r\nFrom this, I've been able to observe\r\n- each time the inference is invoked, it increases my total memory consumption by about 0.18G - 0.19G, which is approximately the size of my saved model files being loaded.  \r\n- my Java heap memory is not permanently increasing; after the inference has finished all heap memory returns to the amount before the inference started.\r\n\r\nI've been sure to invoke the close method of each class that extends AutoCloseable that I've used.  I do not explicitly invoke the close method on the Session and Graph managed by the SavedModelBundle, as its close method invokes the close methods of its Session and Graph.  This is reflected in the code example provided below.\r\n\r\nThis memory leak occurs whether I'm building with GPU acceleration or not.\r\n\r\nTo build the native libraries and Java API from source with GPU acceleration, I'm using the following bazel command (from the 1.6.0 release tag):\r\n\r\n```\r\nbazel build --verbose_failures --action_env=\"LD_LIBRARY_PATH=${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}\" --cxxopt=\"-D_GLIBCXX_USE_CXX11_ABI=0\"  --config=opt --config=cuda //tensorflow/java:tensorflow //tensorflow/java:libtensorflow_jni\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo build the native libraries and Java API from source without GPU acceleration, I'm using the following bazel command (from the 1.6.0 release tag):\r\n\r\n```\r\nbazel build --verbose_failures --action_env=\"LD_LIBRARY_PATH=${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}\" --cxxopt=\"-D_GLIBCXX_USE_CXX11_ABI=0\"    //tensorflow/java:tensorflow //tensorflow/java:libtensorflow_jni\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn an attempt to get more information about the execution of the native code, I've tried to enable debug mode while building the native libraries by repliacing `--config=opt` with `-c dbg --strip=never --compilation_mode=dbg`, however this causes the following exception:\r\n\r\n```\r\nexternal/eigen_archive/unsupported/Eigen/CXX11/src/Tensor/TensorExecutor.h:262: static void Eigen::internal::TensorExecutor<Expression, Eigen::GpuDevice, Vectorizable>::run(const Expression&, const Eigen::GpuDevice&) [with Expression = const Eigen::TensorAssignOp<Eigen::TensorMap<Eigen::Tensor<float, 1, 1, long int>, 16, Eigen::MakePointer>, const Eigen::TensorCwiseBinaryOp<Eigen::internal::scalar_max_op<const float, const float>, const Eigen::TensorMap<Eigen::Tensor<const float, 1, 1, long int>, 16, Eigen::MakePointer>, const Eigen::TensorCwiseNullaryOp<Eigen::internal::scalar_constant_op, const Eigen::TensorMap<Eigen::Tensor<const float, 1, 1, long int>, 16, Eigen::MakePointer> > > >; bool Vectorizable = true]: Assertion `cudaGetLastError() == cudaSuccess' failed.\r\n```\r\n\r\nI originally found the memory leak while using TensorFlow 1.4.0, CUDA 8.0, and cuDNN 6.0.  Before updating the versions, each inference was retaining about 1.4-1.5G of memory; by updating, I managed to reduce this significantly, however still need to eliminate the memory leak altogether.\r\n\r\nI've spent hours trying to figure out how to profile the native code execution, most recently by following these answers from Stack Overflow:\r\n1. [How to profile Native JNI library](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14752459/how-to-profile-native-jni-library)\r\n2. [gprof : How to generate call graph for functions in shared library that is linked to main program](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1838989/gprof-how-to-generate-call-graph-for-functions-in-shared-library-that-is-linke/4959168#4959168)\r\n\r\nI've been unable to successfully compile the native libraries with the debug flag (`-g`) to profile.  I've poked around the bazel build scripts a bit, as I don't believe that the debug mode indicated by the `--compilation_mode=dbg` flag actually compiles the libraries for debugging, however have been unable to locate where I'd add the `-g` compilation flag.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Source code / logs\r\n\r\nHere is my configuration output when configuring with GPU acceleration.\r\n```\r\nilats-admin$ ./configure\r\nYou have bazel 0.6.1 installed.\r\nPlease specify the location of python.
