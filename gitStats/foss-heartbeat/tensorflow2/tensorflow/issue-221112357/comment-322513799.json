Unfortunately, the lack of support for gradients makes <code>TF_NewWhile</code>/<code>TF_FinishWhile</code> a show stopper for my needs (RNN/LSTM). I was hoping for, at least, some kind of stopgap. Also, even after the while-loop gradients are available, I may not be able to use them because I've found <code>TF_AddGradients</code> to be insufficient (I understand improvements are planned). As a result, I've already ported many gradients.</p>\n<p>I'm willing to put in extra work now to get something out the door -- even though it may (hopefully, it will) get torn out as more functionality is exposed by the C API. But in this case, it seems like I'm being blocked from filling in the gaps myself. <strong>Please let me know if I'm misunderstanding the situation.</strong></p>\n<p>Please don't read this too negatively. I appreciate all of the work going into TF. I want to help it succeed.
