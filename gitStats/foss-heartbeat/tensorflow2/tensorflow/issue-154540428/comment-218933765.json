I also tested <code>tensor.eval()</code> in a single loop by myself, and seems time for running this function is not growing. So there might be some places in my code getting the time consumption problem... By the way, I wonder whether or not <code>tensorflow.concat()</code> creates new nodes in tensor graph. Also, I wonder if there are tensorflow methods that creates new nodes. Thanks!!!</p>", "body_text": "@mrry I think you are right.
