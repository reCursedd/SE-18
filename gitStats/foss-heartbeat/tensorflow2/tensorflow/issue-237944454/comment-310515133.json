You can dual boot the `Ubuntu 17.04` on your SSD drive, not virtual box way. The Linux environment is naive to tensorflow and has `compatibility ` with the latest `Python 3 ` and `Nvidia GPU & drivers.` for effective and fast usage. Additionally, you can use Alienware graphic Amplifier as well if my guess is right?\r\n\r\n2.    `Windows` support is highly experimental.  If you want to stick to it than the following word by word instructions with [install tensor flow on windows](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42011070/on-windows-running-import-tensorflow-generates-no-module-named-pywrap-tenso) link will help.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n- Note that the instructions over there recommend using specified versions of `Python, cuDNN, and CUDA`.
