So I am forced to use the layer library? What if I want to use my own implementation? Is there any way to set a flag inside the model_fn? Or to have access to the estimator graph and directly used a scope do build in the same graph? Also, I am wondering how to run validation, assuming I want to train for one epoch and then run the model on the validation set I have to first call <code>.train</code> and then <code>.evaluate</code> that will re-build the graph slowing everything. Any clever way to do so? I think is better to discuss here since It is issue lots of people have and the first link that pop up on google is this one.</p>\n<p>Cheers,</p>\n<p>Francesco Saverio</p>", "body_text": "Thank you @MarkDaoust for the answer.
