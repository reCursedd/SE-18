If I build without <code>--config=mkl</code> the tests pass fine. The issue is that building with MKL uses the bfc_allocator to allocate memory. That allocator explicitly returns nil when an allocation of zero bytes is performed (As a side note, this probably should not be an error or warning if we expect it to happen when we request a zero length tensor). In the case of running without MKL, the allocation eventually calls malloc (or jemalloc or alloc_aligned). The man tells me that malloc(0) is implementation defined and our version returns a non-nil pointer so the code does not throw a null-pointer exception. I suggest using something like the patch I included above for the go side, and maybe downgrading the error and warning messages in bfc_allocator.cc and allocator_retry.cc to something a bit less scary (maybe Info?).</p>", "body_text": "Ok, I think I've tracked down the issue to building with MKL.
