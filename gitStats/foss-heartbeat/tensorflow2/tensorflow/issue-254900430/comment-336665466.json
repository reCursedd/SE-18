Am I supposed to move the code for tf.roll to tf.contrib.manip.roll or still in core but to tf.manip. I figured looking at the example with tf.linalg you probably wanted me to put it into core but I just wanted to check with you. Also did you want me to move ops like slice, concat, stack, and unstack to the tf.manip namespace as well? It seems like a lot of ops in array_ops.py could be considered in the tensor manipulation category but I also wanted to check with whether or not I should add them or just leave them alone. Thanks!</p>", "body_text": "Hi @aselle I've finally had a chance to work on this again and I just have a few questions.
