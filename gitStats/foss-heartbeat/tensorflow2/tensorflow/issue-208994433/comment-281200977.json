The location of the installed python packages is different on the MacOS than on Linux, but the info provided for Linux users on other posts, solves the problem.  If running TensorFlow, not only is the \"numpy\" version stuff critical (ie. looks like you need the multi-array features, which aren't in lower versions?), but package \"six\" is needed, and has to be above version 1.10.  Even though I explicitly installed \"six\" version 1.10, when I would run Python, I was getting \"six\" version 1.4.1.  There was a default Python 2.6 and 2.7 installed on my Yosemite MacOS, which puts the numpy and six packages in /System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/Extras/lib/python.  But when pip and easy_install are used to install new packages, they must get put somewhere else.  As a kludge to get TensorFlow working, I just renamed the numpy and six stuff in the  ..../Frameworks directory (the one indicated above) to numpy_old and six_old.  But that didn't quite work, since the \"six\" program had a .pyc as well as a .py file, which I have learned is compiled bytecode.  You have to rename six.pyc to something different also.  Then, Python and the TensorFlow stuff will load ok.  You can check the versions of the python modules with:<br>\nimport modulename<br>\nprint modulename.<strong>version</strong><br>\nI would use pip and/or easy_install to get the latest modules, but my Python 2.7 was still grabbing the old versions from the ..../Frameworks/...  directory.
