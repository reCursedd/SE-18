I check the file, it seems not the problem. I download the newest tensorflow and I think it is not the protobuf problem. I can build and run the android demo but cannot modified it to use v3 model. I modified parameters as the comments state in TensorflowImageLinsener.java, and I can build the apk but the app crash after running.<br>\nI use SDK 24.0.1 and NDK r12b. I am stuck here for a few days, any suggestions would be helpful. Thanks.</p>", "body_text": "@andrewharp thanks for your reply. I check the file, it seems not the problem.
