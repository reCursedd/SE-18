I modified parameters  (img size, mean, file name etc) except the protobuf thing. I changed the 64 to 256 in the coded_stream.h files which are in /usr/local/lib/python folder (is it correct? and should I compile it after modified ?). That would be helpful if you can give me some suggestions. thanks.</p>", "body_text": "@syed-ahmed hello, I'm following your steps to modified the android demo in order to use the retrained model.
