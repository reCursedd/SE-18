Sabuncu of Cornell University (New York, United States) has submitted on May 20, 2018 a [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.07836)  proposing a new error function for `Neural Networks` (including Deep Neural Networks) aimed at classification with `softmax` function in the output layer,  specially in the case of noisy labels. \r\n\r\nThis new loss function has joined characteristics of `mean absolute error (MAE)` with `cross entropy loss`. \r\n\r\nAccording to the tests carried out, it generates a significant improvement in problems of binary classification or multiclassification with noisy labels, compared to cross entropy loss or mean absolute error (MAE) \r\n\r\nBy e-mail, we exchanged ideas for some time, where I has clarified some points of this paper. \r\n\r\nBecause of the promising results obtained, I've agreed with them that I would incorporate this new function into the repertoire of loss functions in `TensorFlow` to make it available to the community.\r\n\r\nSo I've read the `contribution guidelines` and write Python code for new  function (that I've called  `gen_crossentropy`) and also write the testing code, following the standards of another loss error functions. \r\n\r\nIn my local repository, the test have run 100% well. \r\n\r\nIt's my first collaboration with this fantastic project, so any observations or guidance will be welcome.",
