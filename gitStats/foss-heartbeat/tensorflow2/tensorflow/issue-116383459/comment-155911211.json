Truncated BP works well for when whatever you are optimizing happens (roughly) in the currently unrolled window. With partial unrolling (compared to complete unrolling) you can do more updates over time, which usually improves convergence speed. Obviously you don't want to unroll for too few steps, as that will increase the error during back-propagation too much. For your problem I would recommend to fully unroll (just increase the num_steps to your maximum sequence length).</p>", "body_text": "No, you are correct.
