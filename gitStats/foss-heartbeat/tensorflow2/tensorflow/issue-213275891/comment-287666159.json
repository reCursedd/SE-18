As in my case, I try to train a model for mnist classification dataset, I have followed the quantization tool provided by Tensorflow, the result predicted by the quantized model runned in PC is correct, however, when runned in my Mobile phone with a Snapdragon 820 devices, it got different and wrong predict score.
