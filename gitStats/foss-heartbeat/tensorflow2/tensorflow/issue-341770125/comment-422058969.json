The interesting thing is I was able to quantize deeplab using their training code (which uses the specialize implementation of mobilenetv2) but when I try to use the line tf.contrib.quantize.create_training_graph in mobilenetv2 implementation in slim, I get this error. So I guess I can compare the two and find out the difference....</p>", "body_text": "@HimariO  Thank you for your response.
