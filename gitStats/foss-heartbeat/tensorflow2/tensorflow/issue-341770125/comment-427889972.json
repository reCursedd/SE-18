The issue happens when you want to create an evaluation graph and you don't want to have \"is_training=True\" hence you won't have variables like moving variance. For right now, I just turn off eval graph when I want to quantize, but that's just a workaournd. Any idea what to do to have an eval graph and be able to quantize as well?</p>", "body_text": "@raninbowlalala @HimariO I debugged a lot and found out the source of the issue, but have no solution yet.
