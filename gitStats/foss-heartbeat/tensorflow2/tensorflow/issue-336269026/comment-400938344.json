But the tf.contrib.framework.assign_from_checkpoint_fn return a  function which needs a session to run it. I have to use hook or scaffold to implement it instead of directly add tf.contrib.framework.init_from_checkpoint operation after net building. By the way, I can't  find any document  that describes how to load part of pretrained weights in Estimator,  it often takes a lot of time on finding the right API  for doing this since many API seems to implement similar function. More examples of how to deploy the API should be included in future documents, I hope.</p>", "body_text": "@bignamehyp  Thanks for your suggestion.
