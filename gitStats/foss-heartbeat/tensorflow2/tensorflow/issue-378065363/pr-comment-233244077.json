Note that this algorithm\n+  is agnostic to where the origin is in the coordinate system.  Note that this\n+  algorithm is invariant to orthogonal transformations and translations\n+  of the coordinate system; thus translating or reflections of the coordinate\n+  system result in the same boxes being selected by the algorithm.\n+  The output of this operation is the final boxes, scores and classes tensor \n+  returned after performing non_max_suppression.\n+\n+  Args:\n+    boxes: A 4-D float `Tensor` of shape `[batch_size, num_boxes, q, 4]`.\n+    scores: A 3-D float `Tensor` of shape `[batch_size, num_boxes, num_classes]` \n+    representing a single score corresponding to each box (each row of boxes).\n+    max_output_size_per_class: A scalar integer `Tensor` representing the \n+    maximum number of boxes to be selected by non max suppression per class\n+    max_total_size: A scalar representing maximum number of boxes retained over\n+    all classes.\n+    iou_threshold: A float representing the threshold for deciding whether boxes\n+      overlap too much with respect to IOU.\n+    score_threshold: A float representing the threshold for deciding when to\n+      remove boxes based on score.\n+    use_static_shapes: If true, the output nmsed boxes, scores, classes and ", "path": "tensorflow/python/ops/image_ops_impl.py", "position": null, "original_position": 42, "commit_id": "e433fd8adab6a6646f9c6c738ce70682a15193bb", "original_commit_id": "ff885ef229da8e0e19792b9ce6a9c506d3738157", "user": {"login": "supriyar", "id": 2657489, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjI2NTc0ODk=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/2657489?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/supriyar", "html_url": "https://github.com/supriyar", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/supriyar/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/supriyar/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/supriyar/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/supriyar/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/supriyar/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/supriyar/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/supriyar/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/supriyar/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/supriyar/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "body": "The goal here is to implement the python function `batch_multiclass_non_max_suppression` (in post_processing.py) using the new op.
