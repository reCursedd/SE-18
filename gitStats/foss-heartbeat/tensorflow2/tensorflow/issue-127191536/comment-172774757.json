Sudden loss jump from average 0.05 to 1.8 (thank god it wasnt 2 million again), then slowly back to 0.71 @ step 55000 ( i stopped there). The model seems totally corrupted after that, evaluation gives 48%, which is worse than throwing a dice for a binary task! I understand that i would have to identify the bug for reporting this as a bug, but since i use the default out of the box model for cifar10, this horrible behaviour doesn't look much like just \"bad learning\". I will reroll to step 11000 and monitor again.</p>\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://camo.githubusercontent.com/d6ce9b0302c9e1c6456471ed560c337c5add26d0/687474703a2f2f692e696d6775722e636f6d2f563878705235552e706e67\"><img src=\"https://camo.githubusercontent.com/d6ce9b0302c9e1c6456471ed560c337c5add26d0/687474703a2f2f692e696d6775722e636f6d2f563878705235552e706e67\" alt=\"loss plot2\" data-canonical-src=\"http://i.imgur.com/V8xpR5U.png\" style=\"max-width:100%;\"></a></p>\n<p><a class=\"user-mention\" data-hovercard-type=\"user\" data-hovercard-url=\"/hovercards?user_id=463737\" data-octo-click=\"hovercard-link-click\" data-octo-dimensions=\"link_type:self\" href=\"https://github.com/vrv\">@vrv</a> please re-evaluate the state of this issue or direct it to someone who could have an idea what's going on</p>", "body_text": "it happend again, this time at (around) step 47030.
