Very helpful! The only thing I had to change is \"mode=weights\" instead of \"mode=eightbit\", then I can run the simple app with the quantized Inception v1 model on my iPhone 6 device without crash. And I don't see any performance issue. Maybe you can try the simple project to compare? I'll try the camera one later too.</p>", "body_text": "@lcwyylcwyy Thanks for the info. Very helpful!
