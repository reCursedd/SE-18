You will still get the warning,  even if you install and run the GPU-version. Because this warning come from CPU, when your operation run on CPU and  can be speed up by SSE. I think you can ignore these warnings if you are not so concern with speed. If you do want go faster, you need install tensorflow from source to optimize tensorflow for some specific instruction set.\n\n\n\nThe easiest way of check if tensorflow run on CPU or GPU is open a resource manager for GPU or CPU (ps, nvidia-smi) to check loading when you run your training.\n\nYou can also log the device placement ( config=tf.ConfigProto(log_device_placement=True) ), or use tensorboard to check it.\n\n\n\nFrom: bounces+848413-6da0-scotthuang1989=163.com@sgmail.github.com [mailto:bounces+848413-6da0-scotthuang1989=163.com@sgmail.github.com] On Behalf Of g10guang\nSent: Thursday, August 31, 2017 12:39 PM\nTo: tensorflow/tensorflow &lt;tensorflow@noreply.github.com&gt;\nCc: Subscribed &lt;subscribed@noreply.github.com&gt;\nSubject: Re: [tensorflow/tensorflow] \"The TensorFlow library wasn't compiled to use SSE instructions, but these are available on your machine and could speed up CPU computations\" in \"Hello, TensorFlow!\" program (<a class=\"issue-link js-issue-link\" data-error-text=\"Failed to load issue title\" data-id=\"209460351\" data-permission-text=\"Issue title is private\" data-url=\"https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/7778\" href=\"https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/7778\">#7778</a>)\n\n\n\n<a class=\"user-mention\" href=\"https://github.com/Carmezim\">@Carmezim</a> &lt;<a href=\"https://github.com/carmezim\">https://github.com/carmezim</a>&gt;  If I compute with GPU, will I got this warning?\nAnd how to know if tensorflow run with GPU or CPU?\nThanks.\n\n\u2014\nYou are receiving this because you are subscribed to this thread.\nReply to this email directly, view it on GitHub &lt;<a class=\"issue-link js-issue-link\" data-error-text=\"Failed to load issue title\" data-id=\"209460351\" data-permission-text=\"Issue title is private\" data-url=\"https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/7778\" href=\"https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/7778#issuecomment-326187505\">#7778 (comment)</a>&gt; , or mute the thread &lt;<a href=\"https://github.com/notifications/unsubscribe-auth/AFFDdqPYNDB7QseUwJ6eNtkU1oR_0t9Tks5sdjjagaJpZM4MIq5A\">https://github.com/notifications/unsubscribe-auth/AFFDdqPYNDB7QseUwJ6eNtkU1oR_0t9Tks5sdjjagaJpZM4MIq5A</a>&gt; .  &lt;<a href=\"https://github.com/notifications/beacon/AFFDdkhWIJERtKgV7ARwVUhuVRDlxEGbks5sdjjagaJpZM4MIq5A.gif\">https://github.com/notifications/beacon/AFFDdkhWIJERtKgV7ARwVUhuVRDlxEGbks5sdjjagaJpZM4MIq5A.gif</a>&gt;</div>", "body_text": "Yes.
