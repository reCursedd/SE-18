After searching TF, Mxnet and Caffe,  I find TF has done the most on sparse matrix support. Although TF support sparse tensors, but it still lacks optimization and acceleration for sparse matrix ops. So I hope to do something to improve sparse matrix computations, which will also benefit my daytime work.
