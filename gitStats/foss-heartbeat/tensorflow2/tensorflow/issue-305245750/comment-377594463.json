I am more interested in an API/feature available in TensorFlow which allows you to do dynamic placement of nodes while executing the graph instead of statically assigning nodes to devices before graph execution.  For example, If I have 10 nodes in the graph, after executing first three nodes based on the static placement, is it possible to change the placement of next few nodes or all nodes that are going to be executed ?</p>", "body_text": "@Benyuel thanks for your input.
