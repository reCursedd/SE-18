My task is to build a new model from an existing model, where the existing model has several unused depths and the new model wants to remove them. For example, in one layer, the input depth is 16, but only 12 are actually used for my convolution (the convolution only performed for some input depths); then in the new model, I want to remove the 4 unnecessary depths, and such information was stored in the original model as \"mask\". I have so many such layers needed to be processed automatically. Therefore, they cannot be hard coded nor set as inputs, as they are not inputs of the new model but the intrinsic parameter for building the new model.</p>\n<p>I do not understand what the 3rd option you mentioned; isn't it the same as my above codes?
