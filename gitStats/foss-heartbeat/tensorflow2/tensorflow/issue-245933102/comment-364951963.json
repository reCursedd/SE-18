We're under NDA with them so they're allowed to have the data.\nBut if you take any standard 3d convolution benchmark.  Compile TF with MKL\nenabled and then check against w/o MKL, or better yet, look in VTune and\nsee what's going on.  You'll see that the 3d convolutions are not being\nforwarded to MKL.
