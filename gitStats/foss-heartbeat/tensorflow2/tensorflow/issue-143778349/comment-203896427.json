I updated the code.\n- Good to know about `input_size` and `output_size`, I updated the code to not depend on those.\n  However as the `LSTMCell` is still accepting `input_size`, I still keep `input_size` as a parameter in the `cell_fn` callback. Should it be also removed?\n- The tests are real. I computed the values using [this](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18bkheoJbmMUqdRFrviUy_TiooSjvvpDqiti7hm2EASY/edit#gid=0).
