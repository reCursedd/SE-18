Why do you multiply 3 separate times by `fft_scale` -- in the original paper this is not called for.\n2. Your `diag` variables do not appear to be diagonal, but rather normal complex matrices. \n3. In your `modrelu` function you multiply by `in_c`. From my impression, the paper simply uses as `modrelu` as an activation function and do not multiply the output by `in_c`. \n"}
