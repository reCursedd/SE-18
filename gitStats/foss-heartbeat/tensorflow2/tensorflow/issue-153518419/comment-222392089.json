I was using the transpose op as well, so this is probably what was causing the issue. I'm in the middle of testing other architectures right now, but when I get a chance, i will test the Unitary RNN  and Associative LSTM and post back. I will build from the current master.</p>", "body_text": "@ibab thanks for the update. I was using the transpose op as well, so this is probably what was causing the issue.
