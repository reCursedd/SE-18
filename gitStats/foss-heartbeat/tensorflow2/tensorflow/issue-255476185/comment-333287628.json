I was able to implement ADAG but only with the worker updates using SDG.  When using any optimizer that creates variables, I'm having issues because the variables are by default global variables but they are assigned to the local device.  I'm able to get training to work by saying that each worker is the chief worker, which is a terrible hack. Is there a way to simply remove variables from collections, or have a collection scope similar to variable scope?</p>", "body_text": "@yacoder thanks that tip helped!
