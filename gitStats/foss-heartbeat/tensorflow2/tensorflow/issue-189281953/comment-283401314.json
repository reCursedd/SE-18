I am trying to use bucket_by_sequence_length. But I am not\n able to understand the functionality as others, it will be very helpful if\n you have give a example on some classic data sets like WMT dataset used in\n seq2seq.\n In seq2seq tutorial the bucketing is done manually so I am expecting that\n will be done automatically with these bucketing functions. But I am not\n clear about giving the correct parameters to the function.\n\n It would be a great help if you can give us a tutorial in tensor flow\n website.\n\n Thanks,\n kushwanth naga goutham\n\n \u2014\n You are receiving this because you were mentioned.\n Reply to this email directly, view it on GitHub\n &lt;<a class=\"issue-link js-issue-link\" data-error-text=\"Failed to load issue title\" data-id=\"189281953\" data-permission-text=\"Issue title is private\" data-url=\"https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/5609\" href=\"https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/5609#issuecomment-283346076\">#5609 (comment)</a>&gt;,\n or mute the thread\n &lt;<a href=\"https://github.com/notifications/unsubscribe-auth/ABtimxNcyAqu0b6QILzm733XNJe_e0xRks5rhXk8gaJpZM4KyDNA\">https://github.com/notifications/unsubscribe-auth/ABtimxNcyAqu0b6QILzm733XNJe_e0xRks5rhXk8gaJpZM4KyDNA</a>&gt;\n .\n</div>\n<div class=\"email-fragment\"></div>\n</div>", "body_text": "We are working on a new seq2seq tutorial.
