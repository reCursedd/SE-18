Keep in mind, because you're dealing with\nvariable-length tensors (before minibatching) and we don't have a Padding\nversion of this queue, you should use the .dequeue() method to pull out one\n(shuffled) entry at a time, instead of dequeue_many().  Construct the\nobject with the argument shapes=None.  You can use this queue between your\ninput reader and batch_sequences_by_length in order to shuffle the\nsequences before batching them.</div>\n<span class=\"email-hidden-toggle\"><a href=\"#\">\u2026</a></span><div class=\"email-hidden-reply\">\n<div class=\"email-quoted-reply\">On Sat, Mar 4, 2017 at 1:53 PM, Andreas Madsen ***@***.***&gt; wrote:\n <a class=\"user-mention\" href=\"https://github.com/ebrevdo\">@ebrevdo</a> &lt;<a href=\"https://github.com/ebrevdo\">https://github.com/ebrevdo</a>&gt; Thanks.
