I am trying to use bucket_by_sequence_length. But I am not able to understand the functionality as others, it will be very helpful if you give an example on some classic data sets like WMT dataset used in seq2seq.<br>\nIn seq2seq tutorial the bucketing is done manually so I am expecting that will be done automatically with these bucketing functions. But I am not clear about giving the correct parameters to the function.</p>\n<p>It would be a great help if you can give us a tutorial in tensor flow website.</p>\n<p>Thanks,<br>\nkushwanth naga goutham</p>", "body_text": "@ebrevdo Hi Eugene,\nI have just watched your session in #tfdevsummit it was really good and informative.
