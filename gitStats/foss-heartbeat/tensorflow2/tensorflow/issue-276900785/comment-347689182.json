I'd imagine python creates many threads, but it's strange that slurm actually limits the number of threads. A lot of tensorflow threads are IO threads that don't really correspond to an allocation of CPU resources. Perhaps you can talk to your SLURM sysadmin to increase this limit.</p>", "body_text": "@mrry, do you have any ideas on this?
