My understanding was that <code>final_states = tf.concat(final_states, axis=-1)</code> isn't concatenating the c state and the h state for an LSTM cell, but rather concatenating states of the two RNNs that together compose the bidirectional RNN i.e. c1 concatenated with c2, h1 concatenated with h2. Can you clarify?</p>", "body_text": "@oahziur , I'm a little confused.
