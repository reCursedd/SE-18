Thanks for the feedback, TF team will appreciate. I think in this case though it does not make sense to provide instructions for third party libraries/software as is supposed for users to take care of that themselves e.g. follow official docs already available from NVIDIA, and kind of out of TF range to make sure third party libraries are installed properly by users, so IMO it's out of TF's responsibility. For instance you also notice they don't teach you how to install Python or which dist. etc. But if they decided to to that would certainly save some time for first time users.</p>", "body_text": "@Moondra Nice you got it working.
