How would you think the lack of automatic resource cleanup is normal for a machine learning framework in production. In a model training workflow, how to notify the workflow controller the termination of the training stage to terminate the remaining PSs and to update the trained model to online service in a programmable way?</p>", "body_text": "@weberxie Interesting.
