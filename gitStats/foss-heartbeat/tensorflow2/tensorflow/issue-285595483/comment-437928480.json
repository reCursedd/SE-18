It seems that using flatbuffer schema can generate the list of BuiltinOperator.py. However, how did you generate the list of supported quantized ops using schema? As far as I can see, the supported list of ops can be seen in the file quantized.cc, but there are no other files (similar to the builtin_ops.h) which provide a list for the quantized ops.<br>\nI assume the number of unsupported list of ops for quantized 8-bit and the float 32-bit should be different, right?</p>", "body_text": "@jyoungyun Thanks.
