I pass --allow_custom_ops to toco, I could get TF Lite model successfully. But when i try to use this model in my project, it still get error about Merge and Switch. So my question is how to use lstm TF Lite model? Could you please share the source code of custom operation Merge and Switch in tensorflow lite?</p>", "body_text": "@jyoungyun Hi, I use tensoflow r1.11 right now, when i try to convert lstm model to TF Lite model, I found that Merge and Switch are not supported.
