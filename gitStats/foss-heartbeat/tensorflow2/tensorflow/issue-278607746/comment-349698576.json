Sometimes I wish I had the time to contribute.  As for the \"re-compiling\" to which you refer.  I've seen it done before, however, I'm afraid I don't remember the technique used.  It is possible for the end binary to accept \"either\" xxx.so.8, xxx.so.7, xxx.so.6, etc.   The reason for my preface, is that your next question would undoubtedly be to query me for the technique, which as I write this, I'm afraid is eluding my memory searches at the moment.\n\nThat being said, I have to admit that the vast majority of my software experience comes on the Windows platforms, but if you think about it, if it were NOT possible, then how do windows apps cross so many versions??\n\nAs for using the last method: I'm afraid that I work with several other \"software creators\" (engineers, algorithm designers, programmers, etc...).  So, in order for me to pass along a \"setup\" for each to install so that their contributions will work with what I check in, implies that it is somewhat more generic.  I must put together a \"process\" for including my efforts to their own environments, which will include the end product as well (it is an embedded application).\n\nI can (and have done that), I was merely passing along the desire to utilize the latest available tensorflow WITH the latest available Cuda, cuDNN, etc...  We, attempt to make our embedded environment as recent as possible at the time of the first production unit.  Upgrades become difficult as the number of purchased units increases.\n\nAnd, yes, I have already started the process to set up my environment to build tensorflow from scratch, but will also admit that this is doubtful to be the best answer, as it then requires us (my company - well me right now) to do my own rebuilds each time something else change.\n\nThanks again for you willingness to follow up and for your good suggestions,\n\nMitch</div>\n<span class=\"email-hidden-toggle\"><a href=\"#\">\u2026</a></span><div class=\"email-hidden-reply\">\n<div class=\"email-signature-reply\">________________________________\nFrom: Phil &lt;notifications@github.com&gt;\nSent: Wednesday, December 6, 2017 1:20 AM\nTo: tensorflow/tensorflow\nCc: Moldy01; Author\nSubject: Re: [tensorflow/tensorflow] upgraded tensorflow to use GPU - she's a no worky anymore (<a class=\"issue-link js-issue-link\" data-error-text=\"Failed to load issue title\" data-id=\"278607746\" data-permission-text=\"Issue title is private\" data-url=\"https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/15050\" href=\"https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/15050\">#15050</a>)\n\n\nHi Moldy,\nThe tensorflow core is written in cpp so tf is gcc compiled. However, I'm don't quite get what you mean with re-compiling, as this is not possible from the given binar and you'd need the source code anyway.\n\nHowever, you could still try the last option I mentioned, to download cuda and cudnn manually and store them locally.\nThat is:\n\n  1.  create a folder /home/USERNAME/lib/\n  2.  download the cuda 8 installer and install it to /home/USERNAME/lib/cuda-8.0\n  3.  download cudnn6 and extract the compressed file. There you'll find a folder structure that resembles the one found in /home/USERNAME/lib/cuda-8.0. Copy the files to cuda-8.0, keeping the directory structure.\n  4.  Prepend the lib folder to your LD_LIBRARY_PATH, i.e.\nexport LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/home/USERNAME/lib/cuda-8.0/lib64:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH. Or even better, put this line into your .bashrc so you don't have to repeat step 4 every time you want to use tensorflow.\n\nCheers,\nPhil\n\n\u2014\nYou are receiving this because you authored the thread.\nReply to this email directly, view it on GitHub&lt;<a href=\"https://eur02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Ftensorflow%2Ftensorflow%2Fissues%2F15050%23issuecomment-349566966&amp;data=02%7C01%7C%7C4c2ba30ab7114b15504408d53c823f2f%7C84df9e7fe9f640afb435aaaaaaaaaaaa%7C1%7C0%7C636481452453004762&amp;sdata=dot%2FGn4NNHzvrdqr722m0DZxBDMLkDXezCzsyC%2F0EIY%3D&amp;reserved=0\">https://eur02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Ftensorflow%2Ftensorflow%2Fissues%2F15050%23issuecomment-349566966&amp;data=02%7C01%7C%7C4c2ba30ab7114b15504408d53c823f2f%7C84df9e7fe9f640afb435aaaaaaaaaaaa%7C1%7C0%7C636481452453004762&amp;sdata=dot%2FGn4NNHzvrdqr722m0DZxBDMLkDXezCzsyC%2F0EIY%3D&amp;reserved=0</a>&gt;, or mute the thread&lt;<a href=\"https://eur02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fnotifications%2Funsubscribe-auth%2FADu0aT6pcrfKKrrsNQaXcEpPuRUzIWPrks5s9k5bgaJpZM4Qy9p_&amp;data=02%7C01%7C%7C4c2ba30ab7114b15504408d53c823f2f%7C84df9e7fe9f640afb435aaaaaaaaaaaa%7C1%7C0%7C636481452453004762&amp;sdata=10wyhkgO1uWtJ4D71AmnMHWdheIe5q6hOdTDEdbG3pQ%3D&amp;reserved=0\">https://eur02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fnotifications%2Funsubscribe-auth%2FADu0aT6pcrfKKrrsNQaXcEpPuRUzIWPrks5s9k5bgaJpZM4Qy9p_&amp;data=02%7C01%7C%7C4c2ba30ab7114b15504408d53c823f2f%7C84df9e7fe9f640afb435aaaaaaaaaaaa%7C1%7C0%7C636481452453004762&amp;sdata=10wyhkgO1uWtJ4D71AmnMHWdheIe5q6hOdTDEdbG3pQ%3D&amp;reserved=0</a>&gt;.</div>\n</div>", "body_text": "Phil,\n\nThanks for the info.
