That means you either need to build tensorflow from source or you try to create a symlink pointing from libcublas.so.9.0 to libcublas.so.8.0. However, with the latter you might run into problems later on. Another possibility is to download cuda/cudnn into some local folder and set the LD_LIBRARY_PATH to first search in this folder.\n\n\u2014\nYou are receiving this because you authored the thread.\nReply to this email directly, view it on GitHub&lt;<a href=\"https://eur03.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Ftensorflow%2Ftensorflow%2Fissues%2F15050%23issuecomment-349232010&amp;data=02%7C01%7C%7Cbcbbf7c37dc4400f278308d53bbaed62%7C84df9e7fe9f640afb435aaaaaaaaaaaa%7C1%7C0%7C636480596384299918&amp;sdata=WnC7fNQjG4TtaHcXSCyCysGxPG%2FsMxkXmJq6FNtyKGE%3D&amp;reserved=0\">https://eur03.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Ftensorflow%2Ftensorflow%2Fissues%2F15050%23issuecomment-349232010&amp;data=02%7C01%7C%7Cbcbbf7c37dc4400f278308d53bbaed62%7C84df9e7fe9f640afb435aaaaaaaaaaaa%7C1%7C0%7C636480596384299918&amp;sdata=WnC7fNQjG4TtaHcXSCyCysGxPG%2FsMxkXmJq6FNtyKGE%3D&amp;reserved=0</a>&gt;, or mute the thread&lt;<a href=\"https://eur03.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fnotifications%2Funsubscribe-auth%2FADu0acCj77SXheQN0gwKChx0F1542mKVks5s9P_zgaJpZM4Qy9p_&amp;data=02%7C01%7C%7Cbcbbf7c37dc4400f278308d53bbaed62%7C84df9e7fe9f640afb435aaaaaaaaaaaa%7C1%7C0%7C636480596384299918&amp;sdata=N6%2FgG0iOTMaJnh%2Fzke48PhibDnrVHfMwR1CxwIZhiuY%3D&amp;reserved=0\">https://eur03.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fnotifications%2Funsubscribe-auth%2FADu0acCj77SXheQN0gwKChx0F1542mKVks5s9P_zgaJpZM4Qy9p_&amp;data=02%7C01%7C%7Cbcbbf7c37dc4400f278308d53bbaed62%7C84df9e7fe9f640afb435aaaaaaaaaaaa%7C1%7C0%7C636480596384299918&amp;sdata=N6%2FgG0iOTMaJnh%2Fzke48PhibDnrVHfMwR1CxwIZhiuY%3D&amp;reserved=0</a>&gt;.</div>\n</div>", "body_text": "Phil,\n\nThanks, that's pretty much what I was thinking, except I was hoping to hear that you were re-compiling the prebuilt binaries so that they would include \"Anything less than ...\".\n\nI'm relatively new to Python, so I don't know whether that is even doable, unless they're actually gcc compiled libraries, in which case, it should be doable.
