I'm frequently running relatively small models for which I like doing early stopping on the validation set. What is the best practice to do this without having to write checkpoints every second? This might be more of a feature request, but would it be possible to set checkpoint intervals as a number of steps rather than time? Or to write a checkpoint before an evaluation automatically?</p>", "body_text": "@martinwicke Thanks for the explanation.
