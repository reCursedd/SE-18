Now that I scroll up I realize I hit the same issue that ramarajan09 had 22 days ago prior to the AAR.  It looks like we both got the same exact error message so I'm not sure what is causing that for us.  From further analysis of the apk it looks like dragging it to an arbitrary created libs folder doesn't signal to the APK to include it in the build.  Do you know how these libs can be included as I think that would solve both of our issues?</p>\n<p>One question that I think I might be stumbling on is the libs path.
