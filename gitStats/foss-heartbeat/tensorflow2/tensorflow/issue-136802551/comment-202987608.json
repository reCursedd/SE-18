I mean I can run 512x3, but I would like to run 1024x4 and 1024x5. My batch size is 256. Shrinking batch size to 32, I still can't run 1024x4. So I was wondering if anyone has managed to run 1024x4 or larger. Mabybe model parallelism on multiple GPUs would help.</p>", "body_text": "@rdipietro Thanks.
