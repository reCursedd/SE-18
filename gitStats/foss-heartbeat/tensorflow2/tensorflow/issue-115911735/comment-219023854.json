I tried to freeze the inception-v1 (GoogleNet) and found it just 27MB, a half of inception-v3. This is probably due to the less number of fully connected layers used (infact just one layer in the case of inception-v1) compared to VGG-x architectures. This turns out that  inception arch is really friendly for embedding apps.</p>", "body_text": "@martinwicke I think my guess is right.
