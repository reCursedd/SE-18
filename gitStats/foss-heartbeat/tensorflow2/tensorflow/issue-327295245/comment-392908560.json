Would it be possible to share the graph so that we can investigate and improve our segmenter? Most common OOM issue is due to reservation for TensorRT which will be reduced with TensorRT4.0 GA since we start to share the TensorFlow's allocator and only workspace parameter needs to be tuned now. We are also restructuring the TFTRT workflow which should improve things. In upcoming updates we will add an option to specify placement of ops in to the TRT segments and users will be able to selectively keep certain nodes outside segments.</p>\n<p>Thanks,<br>\nSami</p>", "body_text": "@yegord, Thanks for the investigation.
