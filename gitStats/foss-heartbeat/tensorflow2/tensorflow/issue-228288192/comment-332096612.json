I will try my best to be polite, but it is frustrating that you still haven't completed the builder API for TensorFlow. It is more than a year ago that I pleaded with you to consolidate the many builder APIs so we could have a single API that was complete and well-documented. I am struggling to understand why this is not a priority for you. Perhaps we view software engineering differently. To me the API is an incredibly important aspect of any software library. Perhaps Keras is now the most complete API for TensorFlow and it seems there's a person dedicated to its development. Perhaps you should consider making Keras the main builder API then. But please make a decision for one API, stick with it and finish it. Thanks.</p>", "body_text": "I have now upgraded to TensorFlow 1.3 and this is still missing.
