I have encountered similar problem.  I add queue runner to collection using tf.train.add_queue_runner function  inside the conditional execution context. According to your reply , I should return the operations from true-branch and false-branch function. So I try to return the enqueue operations and the equeue from true-branch and false-branch function. But when I return the queue, tensorflow reports errors: \"Expected binary or unicode string, got queue\"</p>", "body_text": "@mrry  hi mrry. I have encountered similar problem.
