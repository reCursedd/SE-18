I now also use 'is_training' as a constant. Leave it as a placeholder and do periodic testing will change the value of moving mean and moving variance. And the inference time will be longer for it will calculate the mean and variance of the inputs and update the moving mean and moving variance. The right way to do testing is to define different behaviors for train and test as you mentioned.</p>", "body_text": "@tano297 Thank you. I now also use 'is_training' as a constant.
