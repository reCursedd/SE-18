I took a look at the DNS srv records and I agree that this can be used to solve some of the problems we're facing together with cluster resolver. I think the difference between dynamic RPC address resolution and cluster spec propagation is really around when the address translation happens instead of how the address is translated - whether through DNS or not we can do it in both approaches. For example, we can implement an RPC address resolver using DNS srv record as well.</p>", "body_text": "@ajbouh, thanks for your suggestion.
