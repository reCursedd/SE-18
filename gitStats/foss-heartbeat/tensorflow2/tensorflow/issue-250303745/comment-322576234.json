On the other hand, the proposed\nmethod `over-estimates` the final result by setting those class IOU to be 1\n(however they do not really appear in the dataset). To really fix this\nproblem, I think it is better to compute the final mean IOU ONLY for those\nclasses that indeed appear in the dataset.
