Thanks to dennisjenkins@google.com for testing this on Gentoo as well. There are still more that need to be unbundled but this covers enough to be useful already. This has not been tested on any other distro than Gentoo but I don't forsee any big incompatibilities.\nThe libs that are unbundled are configured by setting build --action_env TF_SYSTEM_LIBS=\"comma,sep,list\"\neg:\nbuild --action_env TF_SYSTEM_LIBS=\"com_googlesource_code_re2,nasm,jpeg,png_archive,org_sqlite,gif_archive,six_archive,astor_archive,termcolor_archive,pcre,swig,curl,grpc,lmdb,zlib_archive,snappy,flatbuffers,cython,jemalloc\"\n\nOnce configured, the tarball for the dep will not be downloaded or extracted, and the BUILD file will be swapped to the system_build_file instead which contains different rules to compile and link against the system package.\nThere are also macros if_system_lib(name, a, b) and if_not_system_lib(name, a, b) to configure other things in the build.\nDO NOT MERGE THIS YET.
