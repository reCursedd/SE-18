When I include both libraries I get issues that seem to imply that both TF C++ and Caffe(which uses glog) redefine certain things. This leads to my code not working.\nIs there a way to make TF use glog? Am I doing something wrong? It seems that this is a bug....\nThank you for any help\nSource code / logs\nIn file included from /usr/local/include/tf/tensorflow/core/platform/logging.h:25:0,\nfrom
