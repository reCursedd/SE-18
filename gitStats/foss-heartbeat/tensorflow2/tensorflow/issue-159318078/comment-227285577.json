Imperative mode of execution is a really important feature that many users have asked for. While your implementation is impressive, it doesn't support a major feature that users ask for and we would like to get working, namely, automatic differentiation via <code>tf.gradients</code>. We believe the best way to implement the imperative mode that is efficient and would allow automatic differentiation to work out of the box would need some significant support in the backend. We are working on adding that support currently. I will keep you posted on its progress.</p>", "body_text": "@yaroslavvb Thanks for working on this and sending the PR.
