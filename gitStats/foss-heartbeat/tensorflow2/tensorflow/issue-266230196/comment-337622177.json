Yes, I call predict_scores() multiple times. I have an application where-in new samples (feature set) are generated one at a time, and I need to show their scores. So, I send each sample as it is generated to predict_scores() to get the predicted score, requiring multiple calls to predict_scores().  Tensorflow serving seems like an overkill for my simple local desktop application. So, I was trying to avoid it. I wish there was a simpler way than that.</p>", "body_text": "@facaiy  Thanks for your reply. Yes, I call predict_scores() multiple times.
