I will submit another new issue. The reason for that is when I utilized two GPUs according to your suggestion, it does work and can support bigger batch size, but a NaN error occurs. After tracing back, I find the minimum modification of codes (above) already leads to the same error. I will update this multi-GPU issue later after the new problem solved.
