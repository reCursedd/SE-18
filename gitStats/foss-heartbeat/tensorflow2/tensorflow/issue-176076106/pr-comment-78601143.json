Much of this hardware is designed \n+with machine learning in mind and had features \n+beyond the normal processor. Taking advantage of\n+these novel features is important to make the \n+processor be used to its fullest. For example, the\n+[Intel Xeon Phi](http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/processors/xeon/xeon-phi-detail.html),\n+[KnuPath Hermosa](https://www.knupath.com/products/hermosa-processors/),\n+[IBM TrueNorth](http://researchweb.watson.ibm.com/articles/brain-chip.shtml), etc.\n+Custom support for each of these different processors\n+is needed to make TensorFlow capable of using them.\n+\n+This is a walk through of how to add support for \n+new hardware to TensorFlow. It is assumed that you\n+can link C/C++ code that uses your particular hardware\n+into TensorFlow. For simplicity, I will link\n+code that implement standard BLAS calls.\n+\n+## TensorFlow Class Structure", "path": "tensorflow/g3doc/hardware/adding_support/index.md", "position": 22, "original_position": 22, "commit_id": "36e0cdf04f294bfd51931d4f78e291590ed0d3ec", "original_commit_id": "36e0cdf04f294bfd51931d4f78e291590ed0d3ec", "user": {"login": "vrv", "id": 463737, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjQ2MzczNw==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/463737?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/vrv", "html_url": "https://github.com/vrv", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/vrv/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/vrv/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/vrv/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/vrv/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/vrv/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/vrv/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/vrv/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/vrv/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/vrv/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "body": "The exact class structure is probably subject to change in general, so I think it would be better to just point out the location of the Interface (DeviceBase and Device).\n", "created_at": "2016-09-13T17:00:40Z", "updated_at": "2016-09-13T17:00:40Z", "html_url": "https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/pull/4305#discussion_r78601143", "pull_request_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/tensorflow/tensorflow/pulls/4305", "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR", "_links": {"self": {"href": "https://api.github.com/repos/tensorflow/tensorflow/pulls/comments/78601143"}, "html": {"href": "https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/pull/4305#discussion_r78601143"}, "pull_request": {"href": "https://api.github.com/repos/tensorflow/tensorflow/pulls/4305"}}, "body_html": "<p>The exact class structure is probably subject to change in general, so I think it would be better to just point out the location of the Interface (DeviceBase and Device).</p>", "body_text": "The exact class structure is probably subject to change in general, so I think it would be better to just point out the location of the Interface (DeviceBase and Device)."}
