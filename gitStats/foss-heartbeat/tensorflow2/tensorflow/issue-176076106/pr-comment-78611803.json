So here we add\n+the standard CPU under the name SPU by constructing a \n+set of classes called ThreadPiscine (piscine means pool\n+in French).\n+\n+We will create a new ThreadPool under a different name in \n+the C++ code. Throughout this section, I will refer to it \n+as ThreadPiscine (ie. pool -> piscine) and the hardware as\n+ a SPU (ie. C -> S). I will reimplement the code from \n+TensorFlow with these names.\n+\n+The diff for the minimal changes is broken up into parts here\n+\n+```bash", "path": "tensorflow/g3doc/hardware/adding_support/fake_device.md", "position": 17, "original_position": 17, "commit_id": "36e0cdf04f294bfd51931d4f78e291590ed0d3ec", "original_commit_id": "36e0cdf04f294bfd51931d4f78e291590ed0d3ec", "user": {"login": "vrv", "id": 463737, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjQ2MzczNw==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/463737?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/vrv", "html_url": "https://github.com/vrv", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/vrv/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/vrv/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/vrv/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/vrv/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/vrv/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/vrv/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/vrv/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/vrv/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/vrv/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "body": "As discussed in the comments, this shouldn't really be necessary -- we need to add the APIs to TensorFlow to dynamically add a new device without requiring any source code modifications, so we should probably elide this for now.\n", "created_at": "2016-09-13T17:59:12Z", "updated_at": "2016-09-13T17:59:12Z", "html_url": "https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/pull/4305#discussion_r78611803", "pull_request_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/tensorflow/tensorflow/pulls/4305", "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR", "_links": {"self": {"href": "https://api.github.com/repos/tensorflow/tensorflow/pulls/comments/78611803"}, "html": {"href": "https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/pull/4305#discussion_r78611803"}, "pull_request": {"href": "https://api.github.com/repos/tensorflow/tensorflow/pulls/4305"}}, "body_html": "<p>As discussed in the comments, this shouldn't really be necessary -- we need to add the APIs to TensorFlow to dynamically add a new device without requiring any source code modifications, so we should probably elide this for now.</p>", "body_text": "As discussed in the comments, this shouldn't really be necessary -- we need to add the APIs to TensorFlow to dynamically add a new device without requiring any source code modifications, so we should probably elide this for now."}
