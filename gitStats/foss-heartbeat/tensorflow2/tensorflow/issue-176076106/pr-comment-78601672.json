Much of this hardware is designed \n+with machine learning in mind and had features \n+beyond the normal processor. Taking advantage of\n+these novel features is important to make the \n+processor be used to its fullest. For example, the\n+[Intel Xeon Phi](http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/processors/xeon/xeon-phi-detail.html),\n+[KnuPath Hermosa](https://www.knupath.com/products/hermosa-processors/),\n+[IBM TrueNorth](http://researchweb.watson.ibm.com/articles/brain-chip.shtml), etc.\n+Custom support for each of these different processors\n+is needed to make TensorFlow capable of using them.\n+\n+This is a walk through of how to add support for \n+new hardware to TensorFlow. It is assumed that you\n+can link C/C++ code that uses your particular hardware\n+into TensorFlow. For simplicity, I will link\n+code that implement standard BLAS calls.\n+\n+## TensorFlow Class Structure\n+\n+The class structure for Devices,\n+* [class DeviceBase](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/core/framework/device_base.h)\n+  * [class Device: public DeviceBase](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/core/common_runtime/device.h)\n+    * [class LocalDevice: public Device](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/core/common_runtime/local_device.h)\n+      * [class BaseGPUDevice: public LocalDevice](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/core/common_runtime/gpu/gpu_device.h)\n+      \t* [class GPUDevice: public BaseGPUDevice](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/core/common_runtime/gpu/gpu_device_factory.cc)\n+      * [class ThreadPoolDevice: public LocalDevice](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/core/common_runtime/threadpool_device.h)\n+    * [class RemoteDevice: public Device](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/core/distributed_runtime/remote_device.cc)\n+\n+\n+There is also a structure referred to as a Device Factory,\n+* [class DeviceFactory](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/core/common_runtime/device_factory.h)\n+  * [class ThreadPoolDeviceFactory: public Device Factory](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/core/common_runtime/threadpool_device_factory.cc)\n+  * [class BaseGPUDeviceFactory : public DeviceFactory](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/core/common_runtime/gpu/gpu_device.h)\n+    * [class GPUDeviceFactory: public BaseGPUDeviceFactory](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/core/common_runtime/gpu/gpu_device_factory.cc)\n+  * [class GPUCompatibleCPUDeviceFactory: public DeviceFactory](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/core/common_runtime/gpu/gpu_device_factory.cc)\n+\n+\n+It is clear that TensorFlow is currently built to support 3 major ", "path": "tensorflow/g3doc/hardware/adding_support/index.md", "position": 42, "original_position": 42, "commit_id": "36e0cdf04f294bfd51931d4f78e291590ed0d3ec", "original_commit_id": "36e0cdf04f294bfd51931d4f78e291590ed0d3ec", "user": {"login": "vrv", "id": 463737, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjQ2MzczNw==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/463737?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/vrv", "html_url": "https://github.com/vrv", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/vrv/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/vrv/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/vrv/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/vrv/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/vrv/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/vrv/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/vrv/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/vrv/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/vrv/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "body": "\"Distributed\" isn't really a device, so I would rewrite as:\n\n\"TensorFlow currently supports CPU and GPU devices.
