Much of this hardware is designed \n+with machine learning in mind and had features \n+beyond the normal processor. Taking advantage of\n+these novel features is important to make the \n+processor be used to its fullest. For example, the\n+[Intel Xeon Phi](http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/processors/xeon/xeon-phi-detail.html),\n+[KnuPath Hermosa](https://www.knupath.com/products/hermosa-processors/),\n+[IBM TrueNorth](http://researchweb.watson.ibm.com/articles/brain-chip.shtml), etc.\n+Custom support for each of these different processors\n+is needed to make TensorFlow capable of using them.\n+\n+This is a walk through of how to add support for \n+new hardware to TensorFlow. It is assumed that you\n+can link C/C++ code that uses your particular hardware\n+into TensorFlow. For simplicity, I will link\n+code that implement standard BLAS calls.\n+\n+## TensorFlow Class Structure\n+\n+The class structure for Devices,\n+* [class DeviceBase](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/core/framework/device_base.h)\n+  * [class Device: public DeviceBase](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/core/common_runtime/device.h)\n+    * [class LocalDevice: public Device](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/core/common_runtime/local_device.h)\n+      * [class BaseGPUDevice: public LocalDevice](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/core/common_runtime/gpu/gpu_device.h)\n+      \t* [class GPUDevice: public BaseGPUDevice](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/core/common_runtime/gpu/gpu_device_factory.cc)\n+      * [class ThreadPoolDevice: public LocalDevice](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/core/common_runtime/threadpool_device.h)\n+    * [class RemoteDevice: public Device](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/core/distributed_runtime/remote_device.cc)\n+\n+\n+There is also a structure referred to as a Device Factory,", "path": "tensorflow/g3doc/hardware/adding_support/index.md", "position": 34, "original_position": 34, "commit_id": "36e0cdf04f294bfd51931d4f78e291590ed0d3ec", "original_commit_id": "36e0cdf04f294bfd51931d4f78e291590ed0d3ec", "user": {"login": "vrv", "id": 463737, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjQ2MzczNw==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/463737?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/vrv", "html_url": "https://github.com/vrv", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/vrv/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/vrv/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/vrv/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/vrv/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/vrv/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/vrv/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/vrv/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/vrv/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/vrv/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "body": "Same here for the factories.\n", "created_at": "2016-09-13T17:00:47Z", "updated_at": "2016-09-13T17:00:47Z", "html_url": "https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/pull/4305#discussion_r78601167", "pull_request_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/tensorflow/tensorflow/pulls/4305", "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR", "_links": {"self": {"href": "https://api.github.com/repos/tensorflow/tensorflow/pulls/comments/78601167"}, "html": {"href": "https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/pull/4305#discussion_r78601167"}, "pull_request": {"href": "https://api.github.com/repos/tensorflow/tensorflow/pulls/4305"}}, "body_html": "<p>Same here for the factories.</p>", "body_text": "Same here for the factories."}
