If you want to test scalability - run TF on two GPUs on the same node and compare it with other kits. This is the absolute performance (on 2 GPUs) you can get regardless the interconnect used. The question is then how much you loose replacing PCI bus connection between both with various remote networking technologies - including appropriate hardware and software stacks.</p>\n<p>Regarding Hadoop/Spark - are you running builds supporting RDMA in infiniband environment? What order of speedup have you seen from moving away from ethernet?
