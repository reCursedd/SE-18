The package is indeed installed internally and shown in the xx.runfiles directory in bazel-out/, and does have the correct soname. The problem is internally the genrule doesn't provide the same bash environment (more specifically LD_LIBRARY_PATH) as provided by bazel externally, so all cuda shared libraries are not accessible by the gen_trt_engine_op_py_wrappers_cc binary. I think it must be a problem of either the build config or  the internal bazel config, I'll need to figure it out.</p>", "body_text": "Thanks @samikama for the suggestions.
