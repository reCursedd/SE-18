During the\n+configuration step, TensorRT should be enabled and installation path\n+should be set. If installed through package managers (deb,rpm),\n+configure script should find the necessary components from the system\n+automatically. If installed from tar packages, user has to set path to\n+location where the library is installed during configuration.\n+\n+In order to enable TensorRT support, user has to add `--config=tensorrt` to\n+the build flags during the compilation such as\n+\n+```\n+bazel build --config=cuda --config=opt --config=tensorrt //tensorflow/tools/pip_package:build_pip_package\n+bazel-bin/tensorflow/tools/pip_package/build_pip_package /tmp/\n+```\n+\n+After the installation of tensorflow package, TensorRT transformation\n+will be available.
