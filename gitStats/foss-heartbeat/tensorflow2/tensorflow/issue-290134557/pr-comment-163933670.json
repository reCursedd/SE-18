During the\n+configuration step, TensorRT should be enabled and installation path\n+should be set. If installed through package managers (deb,rpm),\n+configure script should find the necessary components from the system\n+automatically. If installed from tar packages, user has to set path to\n+location where the library is installed during configuration.\n+\n+In order to enable TensorRT support, user has to add `--config=tensorrt` to\n+the build flags during the compilation such as\n+\n+```\n+bazel build --config=cuda --config=opt --config=tensorrt //tensorflow/tools/pip_package:build_pip_package", "path": "tensorflow/contrib/tensorrt/README.md", "position": null, "original_position": 22, "commit_id": "1e4b5b8c0cc1675b9ecac3569c91563a2a4f9984", "original_commit_id": "7035501c1b35d52d80d8fde3a95492d83a96f495", "user": {"login": "aaroey", "id": 31743510, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMxNzQzNTEw", "avatar_url": "https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/31743510?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/aaroey", "html_url": "https://github.com/aaroey", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/aaroey/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/aaroey/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/aaroey/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/aaroey/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/aaroey/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/aaroey/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/aaroey/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/aaroey/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/aaroey/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "body": "We internally decided to remove this option to make the config simpler (so we only have one switch instead of two).
