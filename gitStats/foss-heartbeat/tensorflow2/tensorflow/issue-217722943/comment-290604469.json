This seems like a backward incompatible change (even if the different data types were consistent), on the other hand the adjust_brightness function is a pretty strange definition of brightness, because it seems to reduce the contrast at the same time as changing the brightness. I would have implemented it as using hsl or multiplying by a constant. Do we have any notion of high dynamic rnage image that we want to support?</p>", "body_text": "@shlens, what do you think here.
