That code was a <code>tf.data</code> benchmark script I was using when trying to tune the best parameter setting for input. Initially I was using something like 64 which is the number of cores, but I've increased the number of threads all the way from 64, 128, 256 to 8192 and the performance kept improving so that's why I was using 8192 in that script. I can change it back to smaller values and show more results.</p>", "body_text": "Thanks @mrry.
