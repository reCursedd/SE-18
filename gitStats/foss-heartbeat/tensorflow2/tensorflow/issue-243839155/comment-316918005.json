For example in GANs, I will run in parallel i.e the generator loss in CPU and discriminator loss in GPU. Can this be done as well ?</p>", "body_text": "@asimshankar Wow cool, sorry I was not aware  :) And can I do this in parallel the same thing that you did above instead of sequential for two different functions ?
