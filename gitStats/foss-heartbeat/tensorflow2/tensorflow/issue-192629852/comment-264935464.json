Could you give a minimum example that reproduces the error? Is the first dimension of the 2D Tensor known? Could you set its shape to a complete shape, rather than a partially known shape (that is what is being complained)? Could you also share the code snippet of your manual reshape? I am curious why your manual reshape succeeded without complaining about partial shape info, while the internal reshape failed.</p>", "body_text": "@abred, thanks for reporting the issue.
