In addition to database\n+functionality Apache Ignite provides a distributed file system called\n+IGFS (https://ignite.apache.org/features/igfs.html). IGFS delivers a similar\n+functionality to Hadoop HDFS, but only in-memory. In fact, in addition to\n+its own APIs, IGFS implements Hadoop FileSystem API and can be transparently\n+plugged into Hadoop or Spark deployments. This contrib package contains an\n+intergration between IGFS and TensorFlow.\n+\n+@@IGFS", "path": "tensorflow/contrib/igfs/__init__.py", "position": null, "original_position": 27, "commit_id": "24579bc55c379ea1d43b3d3b9d319038aa12f091", "original_commit_id": "273abe3bd46ce505b610b0bcf88d9c6afc472fce", "user": {"login": "dmitrievanthony", "id": 1028969, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjEwMjg5Njk=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/1028969?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/dmitrievanthony", "html_url": "https://github.com/dmitrievanthony", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dmitrievanthony/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dmitrievanthony/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dmitrievanthony/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dmitrievanthony/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dmitrievanthony/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dmitrievanthony/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dmitrievanthony/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dmitrievanthony/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dmitrievanthony/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "body": "Removed.", "created_at": "2018-10-15T11:57:07Z", "updated_at": "2018-11-07T11:35:25Z", "html_url": "https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/pull/22194#discussion_r225137194", "pull_request_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/tensorflow/tensorflow/pulls/22194", "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR", "_links": {"self": {"href": "https://api.github.com/repos/tensorflow/tensorflow/pulls/comments/225137194"}, "html": {"href": "https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/pull/22194#discussion_r225137194"}, "pull_request": {"href": "https://api.github.com/repos/tensorflow/tensorflow/pulls/22194"}}, "body_html": "<p>Removed.</p>", "body_text": "Removed.", "in_reply_to_id": 224852631}
