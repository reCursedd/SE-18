In addition to database\n+functionality Apache Ignite provides a distributed file system called\n+IGFS (https://ignite.apache.org/features/igfs.html). IGFS delivers a similar\n+functionality to Hadoop HDFS, but only in-memory. In fact, in addition to\n+its own APIs, IGFS implements Hadoop FileSystem API and can be transparently\n+plugged into Hadoop or Spark deployments. This contrib package contains an\n+intergration between IGFS and TensorFlow.\n+\n+@@IGFS", "path": "tensorflow/contrib/igfs/__init__.py", "position": null, "original_position": 27, "commit_id": "24579bc55c379ea1d43b3d3b9d319038aa12f091", "original_commit_id": "273abe3bd46ce505b610b0bcf88d9c6afc472fce", "user": {"login": "mrry", "id": 192142, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE5MjE0Mg==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/192142?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/mrry", "html_url": "https://github.com/mrry", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mrry/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mrry/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mrry/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mrry/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mrry/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mrry/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mrry/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mrry/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mrry/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "body": "This module doesn't appear to import a symbol called `IGFS`.
