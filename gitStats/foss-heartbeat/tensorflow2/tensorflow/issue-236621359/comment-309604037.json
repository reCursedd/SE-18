The use case I am trying accomplish is the randomized hashing to radically reduce training time/resource consumption for deep neural networks in Keras/TensorFlow (as demonstrated in the paper).  I will reread the paper to see if it will be as simple as the initial feature extraction or a more complex architecture.  I suspect it is latter case.</p>", "body_text": "@byronyi Thank you for pointing this functionality in sklearn out for me.
