I have a new idea about the pooling method. Currently there are two pooling methods  (max-pooling, avg-pooling). I want to do some experiment by some new idea about pooling method.<br>\nBut for that i need to find the current pooling functions. But unfortunately i could not find that. Can anyone please help me to do this experiment and help me to find the exact flow of pooling because i am not so much fluent to Python.</p>\n<p>Thanks.</p>", "body_text": "@poxvoculi Hi\nI am working on Tensorflow with Python.
