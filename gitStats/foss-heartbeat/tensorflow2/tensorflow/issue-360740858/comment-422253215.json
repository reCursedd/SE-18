Hoping to finish this soon but just started over the weekend. Getting faster as I'm getting used to the TF APIs. Figured I would put the PR out there in case anyone wanted to help or start commenting on the code. Just finished getting the kernel written for alignment. Basically, 4 kernels:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Calculate alignment of packed sequence (done and tested)</li>\n<li>Pack a sequence (unwritten)</li>\n<li>Unpack a sequence (unwritten)</li>\n<li>Variable length LSTM (mostly done)</li>\n</ul>", "body_text": "@qlzh727 Correct.
