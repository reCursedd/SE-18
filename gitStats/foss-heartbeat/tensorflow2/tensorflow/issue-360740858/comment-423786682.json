Just redid the packing. Now there is just one custom operation <code>SequenceGatherScatterIndices</code>. This operation takes the total sequence length, the sorted sequence lengths, and the sort order. It produces a set of indices that can be used to pack and unpack using gather_nd and scatter_nd, so no longer need those custom ops for packing and unpacking. The single gather_nd or scatter_nd will both remove the padding and sort the batches, so you can do both at the same time.</p>", "body_text": "Hi guys! Just redid the packing.
