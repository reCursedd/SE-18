However, I'm not quite familiar with the 'Tensor' representation to store multiple images in just one Tensor, which compatible with current image decoding method such as jpeg and png. So the code just decode the first frame at this moment, and to be fixed. I'll try in the future. Furthermore, thank you for your help.</p>", "body_text": "Hi @raingo ,\nYou are right.
