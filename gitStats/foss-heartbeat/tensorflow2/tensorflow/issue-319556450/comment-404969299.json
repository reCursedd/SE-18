Some of the bugs you have seen have been resolved in the arena allocator. In particular, the input is now not-destroyed. Previously, subsequent invoke's() after the first invoke would receive different inputs. Now that the inputs are touched. Also, there was an issue resolved with 0 size tensors. I understand you are frustrated. It would also be helpful if you could give us a copy of your original graphdef and your tflite model with repro instructions.  Thanks!</p>", "body_text": "@cogmeta, we're sorry you had trouble. Some of the bugs you have seen have been resolved in the arena allocator. In particular, the input is now not-destroyed.
