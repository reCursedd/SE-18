I have tried my code over Ethernet, and it worked fine. I think that should indicate the network fabrics is fine. Also, one experiment I tried over RDMA did go through as I described in the issue. So RDMA fabric seems fine. The loopback mode won't traverse the network stack, right?</p>", "body_text": "@byronyi Thanks for the quick reply. I have tried my code over Ethernet, and it worked fine.
