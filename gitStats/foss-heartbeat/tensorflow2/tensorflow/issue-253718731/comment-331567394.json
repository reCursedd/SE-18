Also make sure you can successfully build TensorFlow before you start writing code. Maybe I'm overly familiar with the code, but I don't think gradient functions should be too hard to start with. If SoftmaxCrossEntropyWithLogitsGrad proves to be too complicated you can also try a simpler one. Good luck, and looking forward to a PR!</p>", "body_text": "Hi @pbanavara, @facaiy is correct.
