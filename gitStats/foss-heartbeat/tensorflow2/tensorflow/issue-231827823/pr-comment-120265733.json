Normal user\n+ * code initializes a {@code Scope} and provides it to Operation building classes. For example:\n+ *\n+ * <pre>{@code\n+ * Scope scope = Scope.create(graph);\n+ * Constant c = Constant.create(scope, 42);\n+ * }</pre>\n+ *\n+ * <p>An Operation building class acquires a Scope, and uses it to set properties on the underlying\n+ * Tensorflow ops. For example:\n+ *\n+ * <pre>{@code\n+ * // An operator class that adds a constant.\n+ * public class Constant {\n+ *   public static Constant create(Scope scope, ...) {\n+ *      scope.graph().opBuilder(\n+ *        \"Constant\", scope.makeOpName(\"Constant\"))\n+ *        .setAttr(...)\n+ *        .build()\n+ *      ...\n+ *   }\n+ * }\n+ * }</pre>\n+ *\n+ * <p><b>Scope hierarchy:</b>\n+ *\n+ * <p>A {@code Scope} provides various {@code with()} methods that create a new scope. The new scope\n+ * typically has one property changed while other properties are inherited from the parent scope.\n+ *\n+ * <p>An example using {@code Constant} implemented as before:\n+ *\n+ * <pre>{@code\n+ * Scope root = Scope.create(graph);\n+ *\n+ * // The linear subscope will generate names like linear/...\n+ * Scope linear = Scope.withSubScope(\"linear\");\n+ *\n+ * // This op name will be \"linear/W\"\n+ * Constant.create(linear.withOpName(\"W\"), ...);\n+ *\n+ * // This op will be \"linear/Constant\", using the default\n+ * // name provided by Constant\n+ * Constant.create(linear, ...);\n+ *\n+ * // This op will be \"linear/Constant_1\", using the default\n+ * // name provided by Constant and making it unique within\n+ * // this scope\n+ * Constant.create(linear, ...);\n+ * }</pre>\n+ *\n+ * <p>Scope objects are thread-safe.\n+ */\n+public final class Scope {\n+  /**\n+   * Create a new top-level scope.\n+   *\n+   * @param graph The graph instance to be managed by the scope.\n+   * @return a top-level Scope.\n+   */\n+  public static Scope create(Graph graph) {\n+    return builder(graph).build();\n+  }\n+\n+  /** @return the graph managed by this scope. */\n+  public Graph graph() {\n+    return graph;\n+  }\n+\n+  /**\n+   * Return a new subscope with the provided name.\n+   *\n+   * <p>Ops created with this scope will have {@code name/childScopeName/} as the prefix.
