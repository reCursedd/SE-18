They require hardly any hyperparameter tuning.\n+\n+  In Rprop, the direction of each objective variable update is given by the sign\n+  of the partial derivative. The amount of the change is decoupled\n+  from the absolute value of the partial derivative. It is determined by a\n+  step-size parameter, which is individually adapted for each objective\n+  variable.\n+\n+  Rprop was originally proposed by Riedmiller and Braun in the article\n+  [A direct adaptive method for faster backpropagation learning:\n+  the RPROP algorithm](https://doi.org/10.1109/ICNN.1993.298623).\n+  The original Rprop algorithm uses weight-backtracking. It retracts the update\n+  of an objective variable if the update caused a change in sign of the\n+  corresponding partial derivative. The implememented Rprop variant, which is\n+  called iRprop+ and is described in the article\n+  [Empirical evaluation of the improved Rprop learning algorithms](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0925-2312(01)00700-7)\n+  only retracts an update if additionally the overall error increased.\n+  The TensorFlow implementation is described in the article\n+  [Resilient Backpropagation (Rprop) for Batch-learning in TensorFlow](https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1R0o7yDz).\n+\n+  **The Rprop algorithms are recommended for batch learning, _not_ for\n+  mini-batch learning.** The iRprop+ (improved Rprop with weight-backtracking)\n+  algorithm is empirically found to be faster and more robust than the\n+  [standard variant](RpropMinusOptimizer.md).\n+  See [Resilient Backpropagation (Rprop) for Batch-learning in\n+  TensorFlow](https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1R0o7yDz)\n+  for details and references.\n+  \"\"\"\n+\n+  # Values for gate_gradients, taken from base class.\n+  GATE_NONE = 0\n+  GATE_OP = 1\n+  GATE_GRAPH = 2\n+\n+  def __init__(self,\n+               eta_minus=0.5,\n+               eta_plus=1.2,\n+               delta_zero=0.5,\n+               delta_min=1e-6,\n+               delta_max=50,\n+               use_locking=False, name=\"IRpropPlusOptimizer\"):\n+    \"\"\"Constructs a new IRpropPlusOptimizer object.\n+\n+    The pseudocode of the algorithm can be found in the articles\n+    [Empirical evaluation of the improved Rprop learning algorithms](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0925-2312(01)00700-7)\n+    and [Resilient Backpropagation (Rprop) for Batch-learning in TensorFlow](https://openreview.net/forum?id=r1R0o7yDz).\n+\n+    Initialization:\n+\n+    ```\n+    old_grad <- 0 (Initialize the gradient from the previous iteration g{t-1})\n+    delta_update <- delta_zero (Initialize step-size)\n+    t <- 0 (Initialize iteration counter)\n+    ```\n+\n+    The following update rule is performed for each individual objective\n+    variable (e.g., weight), where `g{t}` denotes the partial derivative of the\n+    objective function with respect to the objective variable at iteration `t`:\n+\n+    ```\n+    t <- t + 1\n+    grad_sign <- sign(g{t} * g{t-1})\n+    if (grad_sign > 0)\n+      delta_update{t} <- min(eta_plus * delta_update{t-1}, delta_max)\n+      variable{t+1} <- variable{t} -sign(g{t}) * delta_update{t}\n+    else if (grad_sign < 0)\n+      delta_update{t} <- max(eta_minus * delta_update{t-1}, delta_min)\n+      if (error{t} > error{t-1})\n+        variable{t+1} <- variable{t-1}\n+      g{t} = 0\n+    else\n+      variable{t+1} <- variable{t} -
