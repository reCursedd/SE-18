Rename the separate tensorflow/models **repo** (that contains code pertaining to pre-trained models) to `pre-trained-models` or `pre-trained-weights` and rename the `tensorflow/examples/models` **directory** to something that conveys the fact that it contains research paper models and not pre-trained ones.\n2.
