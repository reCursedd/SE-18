This package provides a high-level Go API for TensorFlow, this\n+package provides the necessary tools to create and manipulate Tensors,\n+Variables, Constants and also to build, load and run Graphs.\n+\n+## API documentation\n+* [Session](g3doc/session.md): Encapsulates the environment in which Operation\n+  objects are executed, and Tensor objects are evaluated.\n+* [Graph](g3doc/graph.md): Contains a set of Operations, which represent units\n+  of computation; and Tensors, which represent the units of data that flow\n+  between operations.\n+* [Tensor](g3doc/tensor.md): Typed multi-dimensional array.\n+\n+## Practical Examples\n+\n+##### Python Graph generated and executed on Go\n+\n+This is just an example that shows how to interact with the provided API.\n+\n+In order to generate a valid Graph you can use the next Python code:\n+\n+```python\n+import tensorflow as tf\n+\n+input1 = tf.placeholder(tf.int64, shape=(2, 2, 2), name='input1')\n+input2 = tf.placeholder(tf.int64, shape=(2, 2, 2), name='input2')\n+output = tf.add(input1, input2, name='output')\n+\n+with tf.Session() as sess:\n+    tf.train.write_graph(sess.graph_def, '/tmp/graph/', 'test_graph.pb', as_text=True)\n+```\n+\n+The previous code prepares two placeholders with names 'input1' and\n+'input2' respectively, and other tensor used as output of the addition of the\n+two placeholders. At the end, it dumps the graph as text into a text file with\n+path:\n+'/tmp/graph/test_graph.pb'.\n+\n+From a Go application, you can use the next code to execute the graph:\n+\n+```go\n+package main\n+\n+import (\n+\t\"log\"\n+\n+\t\"github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tensorflow/contrib/go\"\n+)\n+\n+func main() {\n+\t// These are the input tensors to be used\n+\tinputSlice1 := [][][]int64{\n+\t\t{\n+\t\t\t{1, 2},\n+\t\t\t{3, 4},\n+\t\t}, {\n+\t\t\t{5, 6},\n+\t\t\t{7, 8},\n+\t\t},\n+\t}\n+\tinputSlice2 := [][][]int64{\n+\t\t{\n+\t\t\t{9, 10},\n+\t\t\t{11, 12},\n+\t\t}, {\n+\t\t\t{13, 14},\n+\t\t\t{15, 16},\n+\t\t},\n+\t}\n+\n+\t// Create the two tensors, the data type is recognized automatically as\n+\t// also the tensor shape from the input slice\n+\tt1, err := tensorflow.NewTensor(inputSlice1)\n+\tif err != nil {\n+\t\tlog.Fatal(\"Problem trying create a new tensor, Error:\", err)\n+\t}\n+\n+\tt2, err := tensorflow.NewTensor(inputSlice2)\n+\tif err != nil {\n+\t\tlog.Fatal(\"Problem trying create a new tensor, Error:\", err)\n+\t}\n+\n+\t// Load the graph from the file that we generated from Python on the\n+\t// previous step\n+\tgraph, err := tensorflow.LoadGraphFromTextFile(\"/tmp/graph/test_graph.pb\")\n+\tif err != nil {\n+\t\tlog.Fatal(\"Problem reading the graph from the text file, Error:\", err)\n+\t}\n+\n+\t// Create the session and extend the Graph\n+\ts, err := tensorflow.NewSession()\n+\tif err := s.ExtendGraph(graph);
