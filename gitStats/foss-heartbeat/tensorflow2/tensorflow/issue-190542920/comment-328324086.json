I am also interested extending further with non image based use cases (ex sensor fusion, complex event processing etc on tensorflow with embedded devices esp on Pi). One more interest area is exploring synergies between Keras and TF embeded (most of the current course is structured on Keras with TF backend). many thanks for your help</p>", "body_text": "@samjabrahams @FlorinAndrei @petewarden I am also happy to contribute to this through my course (Data Science for IoT @oxford uni). would you recommend a place to start so we can duplicate the existing implementation?
