(using TF1.0 and P36 fwiw)However while it produces a pretty picture I cannot make sense of the labels.. they are three digit numbers when hovering over the dots in the 3d graph.. Although when I select the softmax layer I get 1-two digits when hovering.. Some further description of the utility of the projection and the meaning of the various components of the model (Component 1-3 in the selector boxes for instance) would be super helpful!</p>", "body_text": "@danielgordon10 Thank you for the sample code, so far it is the only example I have gotten to work at all for visualizing the embedding..
