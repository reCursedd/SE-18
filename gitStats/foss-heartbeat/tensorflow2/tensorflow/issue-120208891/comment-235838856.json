In Bi - directional RNN if the input is [ w1 , w2 , w3 , w4 , PAD , PAD ] , while its reversing internally , will it reverse like [ PAD , PAD , w4 , w3 , w2 , w1 ] . The doubt is because , while concatenating the forward hidden state and backward hidden state ( reversed ) , if the hidden state computes in the backward RNN is starting from left to right , we will lose the information . ( hidden state fw(w1) + hidden state bw(PAD) ) . This is not what we expect I guess . I have not seen the implementation , just want to know if it is processing correctly or not .</p>", "body_text": "Hi , A small doubt .
