I tried pasting your snippets into a script but am getting undefined methods (e.g. variable_summaries, depth_softmax). It would also be extremely useful if you could try to simplify the code while still producing the error. Thanks.</p>", "body_text": "Hi @alexanderalang, can you compile the code you have above into a single script that reproduces the error?
