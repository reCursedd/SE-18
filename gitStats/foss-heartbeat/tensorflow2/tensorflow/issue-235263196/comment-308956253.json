With a small database such as mine, do you think this can affect the model quality? About a bug in my code for that example, that would seem unlikely, as the swap between batch and shuffle_batch really is the only change between the two examples. As of now I don't see a way to condensate the problem ta make it reproducible, I will look into the two functions and come back if I find an explanation other than the \"static\" database.
