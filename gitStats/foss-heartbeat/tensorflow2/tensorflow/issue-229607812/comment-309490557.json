Unfortunately I'm not very familiar with this code, so I can't give you any specific tips without digging in myself... assuming you can still repro the confusing error message yourself, it would be useful even if you can just understand and explain how the error arises (this is always a great way to learn about a new codebase too). Hopefully once you have that understanding, it won't be too hard to detect this condition earlier in the stack and return a more useful error message. Feel free to report back here with any findings or questions.</p>", "body_text": "Hi @rohan-varma, it'd be great if you can look into this!
