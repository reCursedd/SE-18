I am using the inceptionv3 model , run the train_image_classifier.py for training, and eval_image_classifier for validation. Now i want to test the model on the new images. So can i use eval_image_classifier or do i need to freeze graph for the retrained model and use it for testing by writing another script like label_image.py ? freezing the graph has given me lot of errors. i got the same error as u posted.</p>", "body_text": "@civilman628\ni am confused regarding the freeze graph issue.
