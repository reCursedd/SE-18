May i know which version of gcc was used\nwhen you compile the gpu version of tensorflow v1.2.0-rc2?\n\nActually, for my case, the cpu version of tensorflow v1.2.0-rc2 could be\ncompiled without  any problem. Do you think this issue in gpu version is\nreally caused by my gcc compiler? Is there any way that just change some\nminor parts of certain *.bzl or BUILD file rather than re-compile the whole\nsource code of gcc?\n\nThanks again for your help.\nBest regards\nXin\n\n\n2017-06-13 14:00 GMT-04:00 gunan &lt;notifications@github.com&gt;:</div>\n<span class=\"email-hidden-toggle\"><a href=\"#\">\u2026</a></span><div class=\"email-hidden-reply\">\n<div class=\"email-quoted-reply\"> I too have sees this when building for CentOS.
