I think the build file used for\nbuilding nccl you mentioned should be this one:\n\"/home/hpc-xin/.cache/bazel/_bazel_hpc-xin/c5e302e32d7acb9c3e4fce8142d1cd66/external/nccl_archive/BUILD\".\n\n\nActually, i spend sometime to checked this file yesterday, however, i have\nno idea about how to change it. Could you help me figure out how to change\nit?\n\nBTW, the compiling error shows that \"this rule is missing dependency\ndeclarations for the following files included by 'external/nccl_archive/src/\nlibwrap.cu.cc':\" and all of related files are listed afterwards. However, i\ncheck all of those files one by one, and all of them are exactly existed.\n\nThanks so much for your help.\nBest regards\nXin\n\n2017-06-13 4:27 GMT-04:00 Andrew Selle &lt;notifications@github.com&gt;:</div>\n<span class=\"email-hidden-toggle\"><a href=\"#\">\u2026</a></span><div class=\"email-hidden-reply\">\n<div class=\"email-quoted-reply\"> Could you try to solve it like others have just to make sure you have\n everything working otherwise.
