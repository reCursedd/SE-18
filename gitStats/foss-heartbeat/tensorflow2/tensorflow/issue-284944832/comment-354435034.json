However, cleaning the Android TF Demo project completely and rebuilding, I expect that an updated and aligned version of libtensorflow_inference.so and libtensorflow_demo.so are built from local sources or downloaded anew, (depending on the value of \"nativeBuildSystem\" in build.gradle? I only succeed setting it to \"none\") and the mismatch should disappear. But this is not what happens to me and the error is still there.
