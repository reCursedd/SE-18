On the line defining <code>indices</code>, where the error occurs, for the value/range of <code>j</code>, in my actual code it will be a different range. For example, instead of going from <code>tf.range(0, tf.shape(temp)[1])</code>, it will go to something like <code>tf.range(self.k, self.k + tf.shape(temp)[1])</code>. Doing that wouldn't work in the example I uploaded, but it's required in my main program.
