I checked everything,I even open it to view the image, everything\nlooked right, but for some reason for me when the images is moved from a\nfolder to another some transfer method causes jpeg to loss some bits from\nit's base64 string.......no idea why. When I compared the Actual base64\nthen I saw the string was slightly different.......then I tried a different\ntransfer method, when the base64 string is 100% the same.....then it\nworked. No idea why, I think the Tensorflow has to mount the image into the\nimage parser in C++ then read it, so basically the system couldn't mount\nthe image to parse and gave that error, if you guys base64 is correct or\nfile format is correct, maybe take a look at the log to see if the image is\neven getting read correctly.</div>\n<span class=\"email-hidden-toggle\"><a href=\"#\">\u2026</a></span><div class=\"email-hidden-reply\">\n<div class=\"email-quoted-reply\">On 23 Feb 2018 20:16, \"clovking\" ***@***.***&gt; wrote:\n <a class=\"user-mention\" href=\"https://github.com/clarklight\">@clarklight</a> &lt;<a href=\"https://github.com/clarklight\">https://github.com/clarklight</a>&gt; , I meet a silimar question\n with you when i train models on google TensorFlow Object Detection API, May\n i ask if the question has been solved? what's the problem and how to\n solved? thank you!\n\n \u2014\n You are receiving this because you were mentioned.\n Reply to this email directly, view it on GitHub\n &lt;<a class=\"issue-link js-issue-link\" data-error-text=\"Failed to load issue title\" data-id=\"206957663\" data-permission-text=\"Issue title is private\" data-url=\"https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/7434\" href=\"https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/7434#issuecomment-367993507\">#7434 (comment)</a>&gt;,\n or mute the thread\n &lt;<a href=\"https://github.com/notifications/unsubscribe-auth/AI3mgCFNfgVN0Sh545XIyY8uOW1Hjt0gks5tXqwogaJpZM4L-E1a\">https://github.com/notifications/unsubscribe-auth/AI3mgCFNfgVN0Sh545XIyY8uOW1Hjt0gks5tXqwogaJpZM4L-E1a</a>&gt;\n .\n</div>\n<div class=\"email-fragment\"></div>\n</div>", "body_text": "For me anyway the jpeg looked like it was correct, the format looked\ncorrect.
