Sorry that I haven't read that paper (my interest is not in ASR) so that I don't know if the decrease of loss is good or not. But I think you can start with 10% data to see if you can overfit (and determine the size of the network, tune the parameters, etc.). Or maybe choose another learning algorithm (preferably with momentum), start from a large learning rate and gradually decrease it. Those are all very common ways to debug a network.</p>", "body_text": "@rajkumarcm I just simply feed the concatenated output into next layer.
