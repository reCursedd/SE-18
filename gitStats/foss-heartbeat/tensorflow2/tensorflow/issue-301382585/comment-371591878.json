I fixed the issue by using an earlier tensorflow models commit(about 6 months ago). Since I was following a tutorial I thought that some changes in the newer version might be causing the problem and indeed that was the case.  My data is indeed readable in the execution environment, the sizes are correct and I have already trained my model ,so I do not think that I might have caused the issue(not trying to be rude!) . I provide the tf commit for the models and my FloydHub job that trained the model:<br>\nTF  : <a href=\"http://download.tensorflow.org/models/object_detection/ssd_mobilenet_v1_coco_11_06_2017.tar.gz\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://download.tensorflow.org/models/object_detection/ssd_mobilenet_v1_coco_11_06_2017.tar.gz</a><br>\nFloydHub Job : <a href=\"https://www.floydhub.com/valiok98/projects/image_raspberrypi2/82\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.floydhub.com/valiok98/projects/image_raspberrypi2/82</a><br>\nHope I was able to provide help</p>", "body_text": "Hi @poxvoculi and thanks for answering.
