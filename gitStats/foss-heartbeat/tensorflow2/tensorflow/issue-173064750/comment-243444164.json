I made use of <code>tf.contrib.layers.sparse_column_with_hash_bucket</code> with <code>tf.contrib.layers.embedding_column</code> to handle my categorical inputs. I restored <code>_Parse_Dense</code> to its original state as it was then receiving 2D inputs as expected via this method. I think if this Estimator is refactored it will be in the best interest to allow it to accept feature_column inputs.
