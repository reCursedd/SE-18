Great to hear you have time to get the cmake build up on jenkins! Please let me know if I can help. Right now the cmake build is pretty rudimentary. The tutorial compiles on Mac OSX/Ubuntu, but segfaults for some reason that needs to be fixed. We also need to add SWIG and GPU support to the cmake build. I'll try to work on this some over the next couple weeks, but would be great if any other folks are interested in helping :)</p>", "body_text": "@jendap Just squashed the commits.
