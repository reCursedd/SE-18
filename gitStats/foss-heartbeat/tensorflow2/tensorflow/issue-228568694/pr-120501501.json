The reason that this bug is subtle is that it only affects tensors used by `_linear` internally.\r\n\r\nFor future reference, the signature and docstring of `_linear` are:\r\n```python\r\ndef _linear(args, output_size, bias, bias_start=0.0):\r\n  \"\"\"Linear map: sum_i(args[i] * W[i]), where W[i] is a variable.\r\n\r\n  Args:\r\n    args: a 2D Tensor or a list of 2D, batch x n, Tensors.\r\n    output_size: int, second dimension of W[i].\r\n    bias: boolean, whether to add a bias term or not.\r\n    bias_start: starting value to initialize the bias; 0 by default.\r\n\r\n  Returns:\r\n    A 2D Tensor with shape [batch x output_size] equal to\r\n    sum_i(args[i] * W[i]), where W[i]s are newly created matrices.\r\n\r\n  Raises:\r\n    ValueError: if some of the arguments has unspecified or wrong shape.\r\n  \"\"\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n**The Problem.**\r\nFrom the docsting of `_linear`, the expected behavior of the function is that it should return an output `y` such that `y = sum_i(args[i] * W[i])`, indicating a batch-wise `matmul` (formerly known as `batch_matmul`). This wasn't actually how `_linear` was implemented, though. Instead, all `args` were concatenated and the weights were chosen to have rank 2, i.e.\r\n```python\r\nx = concat(args, axis=1)  # x.shape == (batch_size, total_arg_size)\r\nw = Variable(...)         # w.shape == (total_arg_size, output_size)\r\ny = matmul(x, w)          # y.shape == (batch_size, output_size)\r\n```\r\nNow, the main problem here is that **`w` is not block-diagonal**, which means that it contains more entries than it should.\r\n\r\n**The Solution.**\r\nThe solution is to use batch-wise `matmul` instead. In order to do this, we need `x` and `w` to be rank-3 (rather than rank-2) tensors, e.g.\r\n```python\r\nx = stack(args, axis=0)  # x.shape == (num_args, batch_size, input_size)\r\nw = Variable(...)        # w.shape == (num_args, input_size, output_size / num_args)\r\ny = matmul(x, w)         # y.shape == (num_args, batch_size, output_size / num_args)\r\ny = reshape(transpose(y, [1, 0, 2]), [batch_size, output_size])\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Tests.**\r\nI ran `tensorflow/contrib/rnn/python/kernel_tests/core_rnn_cell_impl_test.py`, but it was failing all over the place. I expected this, because the `_linear` is used in many of the rnn cell classes. The tests were failing in more places than just the place that covered `_linear`. Let me know if I need to update the unit tests too. Also, the change in the PR put somewhat more stringent constraints on the shapes of the input `args`, i.e. they must all be the same. In the previous implementation, only the axis-0 sizes (`batch_size`) needed to be the same. We could use padding and slicing if we need to be able to handle different axis-1 sizes (`input_size`).", "created_at": "2017-05-14T20:44:36Z", "updated_at": "2017-05-15T06:49:08Z", "closed_at":
