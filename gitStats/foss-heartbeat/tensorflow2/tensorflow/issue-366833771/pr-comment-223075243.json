Yes, I encountered a segfault when my NNAPI calls squeeze operation. Actually, operand_type.dimensions[0] is equal num_values and it is also equal to values[0], because vector is 1-D tensor. But the num_values is just a local variable,  it will be removed when the function call is finished.  Then, the .dimensions pointer will point to other address. I think that's the reason I met segfault here. So .dimensions is better to equal values or use a reference for num_values.
