This might be silly, but have you considered adjusting your <code>PYTHONPATH</code> variable? With that you might be able to get it to find your tensorflow package as well as protobuf. Basically something like this, if <code>import google.protobuf</code> succeeded when you ran <code>python</code> without the path:</p>\n<pre><code>PYTHONPATH=$TF_INSTALL_DIR/lib/python2.7/site-packages:$PYTHONPATH python\n&gt;&gt;&gt; import tensorflow\n...\n</code></pre>\n<p>And, of course, using virtualenv might help (it works great for me), but it looks like you specifically don't want to go that route, since you have it as a submodule. Good luck!</p>", "body_text": "@rdadolf - thanks for updating to the latest, which eliminates the issue I was commenting on.
