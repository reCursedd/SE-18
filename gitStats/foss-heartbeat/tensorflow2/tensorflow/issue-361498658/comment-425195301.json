In your case, expand_dims may not be the best solution as it only changes the shape by adding 1 to dimensions. You can use <code>tf.Variable</code> and <code>tf.reshape</code> to convert 1D filter to 2D then use <code>tf.layers.conv2d</code> for quantization when working with actual graph.</p>", "body_text": "@joe-antognini Thanks for the clarification.
