I am doing deep model research and want to add this kind of operation in my new model. Lucily I've found the unsorted_segment_sum implement. But it is a little different as what I want. I think add a keep_dims parameter is a good idea in this operation. I'm not expert in adding or changing a new operation in tensorflow. I will be very grateful if anyone could help.</p>", "body_text": "@roya0045 ,thank you very much for you kind help.
