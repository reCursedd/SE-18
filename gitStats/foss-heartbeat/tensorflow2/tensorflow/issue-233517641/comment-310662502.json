Basically the TX1 says it's using aarch64 and so even with the arm64 deb I couldn't install it. Perhaps a successful upgrade of CUDA would make it possible to install tensorflow above v1.0, which would enable a lot of other operations like quantization. thanks to <a class=\"user-mention\" data-hovercard-type=\"user\" data-hovercard-url=\"/hovercards?user_id=11670670\" data-octo-click=\"hovercard-link-click\" data-octo-dimensions=\"link_type:self\" href=\"https://github.com/jeichel-miovision\">@jeichel-miovision</a> in advance for trying out!</p>", "body_text": "@jeichel-miovision @sugartom I wasn't able to upgrade the cuda in the past due to some architectural issues.
