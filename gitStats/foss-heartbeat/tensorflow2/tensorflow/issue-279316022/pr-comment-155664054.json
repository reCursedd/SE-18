The following snippet constructs a simple\n+  TensorFlow graph that invokes the `np.sinh()` NumPy function as a operation\n+  in the graph:\n+\n+  ```python\n+  def my_func(x):\n+    # x will be a numpy array with the contents of the placeholder below\n+    return np.sinh(x)\n+  inp = tf.placeholder(tf.float32)\n+  y = tf.py_func(my_func, [inp], tf.float32)\n+  ```\n+\n+\n+  **N.B.** The `tf.py_func()` operation has the following known limitations:\n+\n+  * The body of the function (i.e. `func`) will not be serialized in a\n+    `GraphDef`. Therefore, you should not use this function if you need to\n+    serialize your model and restore it in a different environment.\n+\n+  * The operation must run in the same address space as the Python program\n+    that calls `tf.py_func()`. If you are using distributed TensorFlow, you\n+    must run a `tf.train.Server` in the same process as the program that calls\n+    `tf.py_func()` and you must pin the created operation to a device in that\n+    server (e.g. using `with tf.device():`).\n+\n+  Args:\n+    func: A Python function, which accepts a list of NumPy `ndarray` objects\n+      having element types that match the corresponding `tf.Tensor` objects\n+      in `inp`, and returns a list of `ndarray` objects (or a single `ndarray`)\n+      having element types that match the corresponding values in `Tout`.\n+    args: A list of `Tensor` objects.\n+    kwargs: A dict with `Tensor` objects as values.\n+    output_types: A nested structure of tensorflow data types or a single\n+      tensorflow data type if there is only one, indicating what `func` returns.\n+    output_shapes: Same as output_types, except the types are replaces with\n+      shapes (optional).\n+    stateful: (Boolean.) If True, the function should be considered stateful.\n+      If a function is stateless, when given the same input it will return the\n+      same output and have no observable side effects. Optimizations such as\n+      common subexpression elimination are only performed on stateless\n+      operations.\n+    name: A name for the operation (optional).\n+\n+\n+  \"\"\"\n+  from tensorflow.python.framework import tensor_shape", "path": "tensorflow/python/ops/script_ops.py", "position": null, "original_position": 56, "commit_id": "93cc00cd0bb28144a435324cd9d2f6db4845594a", "original_commit_id": "c92cbe13300ebcd56887ac2d0e74450e122154fc", "user": {"login": "boeddeker", "id": 13744128, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjEzNzQ0MTI4", "avatar_url": "https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/13744128?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/boeddeker", "html_url": "https://github.com/boeddeker", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/boeddeker/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/boeddeker/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/boeddeker/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/boeddeker/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/boeddeker/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/boeddeker/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/boeddeker/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/boeddeker/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/boeddeker/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "body": "I will move it to the top in the next commit.", "created_at": "2017-12-07T22:51:13Z", "updated_at": "2018-01-11T14:32:07Z", "html_url": "https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/pull/15121#discussion_r155664054", "pull_request_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/tensorflow/tensorflow/pulls/15121", "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR", "_links": {"self": {"href": "https://api.github.com/repos/tensorflow/tensorflow/pulls/comments/155664054"}, "html": {"href": "https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/pull/15121#discussion_r155664054"}, "pull_request": {"href": "https://api.github.com/repos/tensorflow/tensorflow/pulls/15121"}}, "body_html": "<p>I will move it to the top in the next commit.</p>", "body_text": "I will move it to the top in the next commit.", "in_reply_to_id": 155658817}
