I don't think I can help you much more than pointing you to that documentation. It states that each binary should be around 11Mb so perhaps there is a problem with your binary compilation method. As I don't have experience with Tensorflow on iOS then i'm not sure whether you've come across a bug or not. Hopefully someone more qualified can come and help you.
