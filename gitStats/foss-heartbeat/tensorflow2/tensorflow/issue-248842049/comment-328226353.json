The only use case I have in my mind is for when one imports a graph from a GraphDef.

When manipulating graphs within Scala, no C-side functionality is needed as I can do the book-keeping there. And this use case should not be critical for efficiency, given that you're importing a GraphDef anyway.</p>", "body_text": "@iganichev That's great, thanks for all the answers! :)\nRegarding 4, that solution is totally fine.
