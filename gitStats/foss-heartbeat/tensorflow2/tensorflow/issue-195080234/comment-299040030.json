That's pretty confusing indeed. And I guess this involves a lot of potential duplicate implementations. I'm generally unclear with respect to \"functions\" in the context of TensorFlow graphs.

What prevents you from importing those in the C API directly so that they're always available?</p>", "body_text": "@suharshs I see. That's pretty confusing indeed.
