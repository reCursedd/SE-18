That being said, many ops do not yet have C++  gradients implemented, so the exposed API may break for some unknown ops. In these cases contributions using the above instructions would be much appreciated :)</p>", "body_text": "@malmaud As you said C++ gradient calculation is not currently exposed via the C api; I will look into adding that in the next few weeks.
