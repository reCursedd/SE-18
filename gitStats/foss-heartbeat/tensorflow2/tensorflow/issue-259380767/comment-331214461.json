I think I agree for the most part. My concern though is that there is certain utilities that should be provided by the native library. For example, right now if I want to implement a \"summary_writer\" I would have to implement a writer for the right format and make sure it's compatible with tensorflow. And every other API, for other languages, should do the same. So, given that there is this agreed upon file format, doesn't it makes sense to provide utilities for working with it for other languages? And given that these utilities exist, maybe we could create a separate library (not part our C API), providing an interface for those utilities. What do you think? And please, let me know if there is currently another way to create a summary writer using the c api.</div>\n<span class=\"email-hidden-toggle\"><a href=\"#\">\u2026</a></span><div class=\"email-hidden-reply\">\n<div class=\"email-quoted-reply\">On Sep 21, 2017, 12:29 PM -0400, Yaroslav Bulatov ***@***.***&gt;, wrote:\n sorry for drive-by comment -- providing readers lib/io in C_API feels a little weird -- the API comprises methods for managing computational graph.
