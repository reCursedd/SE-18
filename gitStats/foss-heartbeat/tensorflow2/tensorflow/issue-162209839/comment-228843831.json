I will look into the code for transpose and try to extend it to n dimensions for sparse tensor too. If I understand <code>tf.gather</code> correctly, it can permute along the axis=0, but here it needs to be done along axis=1. I couldn't think of any approach other than transposing the indices matrix and gather and transpose back. Could you please let me know how to do this ? Sorry for my questions but I am new to contributing here and am trying to understand the codebase better. Thanks.</p>", "body_text": "Thank you for the suggestions.
