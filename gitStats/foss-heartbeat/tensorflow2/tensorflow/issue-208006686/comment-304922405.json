So much to do and not enough time in the day.  :-)  I just rewrote most of the code that the Hong Kong University uses for their tests and started using the <a href=\"https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tensorflow/contrib/data\">DataSets</a> which is new in TF 1.2 (RC right now).  I have found it to be much easier and doing side by side testing with queues it is significantly faster.  For something like CIFAR-10 and your code (I think you were using the dict approach) it is really easy to switch.
