I don't want to count along the time axis, I want to count one feature(i.e. hole card 1) and the second feature (i.e. hole card 2) with the same classes together, while these two features are represented in one string tensor of shape <code>[batch, time, 2]</code>. I know I could just use two separate columns for it, but it's unnecessary because the network would have to learn one relationship twice.<br>\nSo I have a Tensor <code>hole_cards</code> of shape <code>[batch, time, 2]</code>, which looks like this <code>hole_cards[0][0][:] = ['Ah', 'Kd']</code>. So, for example, if the class space is <code>[Ah, Ad, Kh, Kd]</code> I want to transform <code>['Ah', 'Kd']</code> to <code>[1,0,1,0]</code>. And then having an additional time and batch axis. So the combined column would have shape <code>[batch, time, 4]</code> for this example or 52 instead of 4 for a complete poker deck.</p>", "body_text": "Thanks, @karmel, I think the important thing is that I talk about multi-hot encoding.
