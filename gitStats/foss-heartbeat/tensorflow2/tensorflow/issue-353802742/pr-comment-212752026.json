This contrib package\n+   contains an integration between Apache Ignite and TensorFlow. The\n+   integration is based on tf.data from TensorFlow side and Binary Client\n+   Protocol from Apache Ignite side. It allows to use Apache Ignite as a\n+   datasource for neural network training, inference and all other\n+   computations supported by TensorFlow.
