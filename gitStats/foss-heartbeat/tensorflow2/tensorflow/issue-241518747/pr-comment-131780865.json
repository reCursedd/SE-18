It uses gRPC as control plane to setup rendezvous for each tensor transmission, and utilizes [GPU Direct RDMA](https://developer.nvidia.com/gpudirect) whenever possible to transmit tensors in remote GPU memory through network interface card (NIC), bypassing host memory and CPU entirely. It gracefully falls back to ordinary RDMA or even gRPC when GDR is not available.\n+\n+Design\n+===\n+\n+The GDR out-of-band transport is designed to avoid any unnecessary memory copies, especially for large tensors (>100MB). That typically requires registration of tensor buffers to NIC in an ad-hoc manner, which is rather slow as described in the design trade-off of the verbs runtime. The verbs runtime thus chooses to manager its own NIC-registered buffers and copy the tensors from/to those buffers for every single tensor transfer.", "path": "tensorflow/contrib/gdr/README.md", "position": null, "original_position": 9, "commit_id": "241c020c64410ca16683a7a7f42b223f422e5dae", "original_commit_id": "9bb2c8eda776f5a4a464cce56f61cbfcf33564a8", "user": {"login": "poxvoculi", "id": 15676913, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE1Njc2OTEz", "avatar_url": "https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/15676913?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/poxvoculi", "html_url": "https://github.com/poxvoculi", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/poxvoculi/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/poxvoculi/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/poxvoculi/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/poxvoculi/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/poxvoculi/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/poxvoculi/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/poxvoculi/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/poxvoculi/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/poxvoculi/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "body": "s/to manager/to manage/\r\n", "created_at": "2017-08-07T22:33:20Z", "updated_at": "2017-08-08T01:02:01Z", "html_url": "https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/pull/11392#discussion_r131780865", "pull_request_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/tensorflow/tensorflow/pulls/11392", "author_association": "MEMBER", "_links": {"self": {"href": "https://api.github.com/repos/tensorflow/tensorflow/pulls/comments/131780865"}, "html": {"href": "https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/pull/11392#discussion_r131780865"}, "pull_request": {"href": "https://api.github.com/repos/tensorflow/tensorflow/pulls/11392"}}, "body_html": "<p>s/to manager/to manage/</p>", "body_text": "s/to manager/to manage/"}
