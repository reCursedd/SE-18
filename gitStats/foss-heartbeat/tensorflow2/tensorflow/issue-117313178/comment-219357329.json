If someone could help me out with this, I'd be able to do so- I just don't have much (if any) time to dedicate to this at the moment.\n<ul>\n<li>To follow up: are you following the instructions I wrote exactly? Instead of modifying the swap file <code>/etc/dphys-swapfile</code>, the instructions call for mounting an additional USB drive. Theoretically, swap space should be swap space, but I imagine putting more bottlenecks on the SD card isn't helpful</li>\n<li>Did you edit the file <code>scripts/bootstrap/compile.sh</code> inside of the Bazel repository? The <code>javac</code> command used by Bazel is in that script, and you may need to specify the maximum heap size there (as instructed in the guide)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>The question of speed is where the conversation is right now.
