I just finished putting the 0.8.0 pip release out for the Raspberry Pi, so I'm hoping to have a few spare minutes over the next few weeks to check out some of the speed issues. From your info, it sounds like the problem could be at the operating system level, as Raspbian is still a 32-bit OS. The Odroid is certainly a more powerful machine than the Pi, but if the ImageNet model only takes 4 cores on both, I don't see the Pi lagging behind that badly.</p>\n<p>Hopefully I (or someone) can find something a bit more conclusive and precise for this.</p>", "body_text": "@austinsteamboat Thanks for the info!
