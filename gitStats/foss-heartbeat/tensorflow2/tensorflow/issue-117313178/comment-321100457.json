Have you guys tested if the python and c++ versions have\n similar performance. When I ran object detection model using python, I can\n clearly see only one core being used and it takes 6 seconds to process 1\n image(640x480 res). I tried configuring the intra_ops config parameter, but\n no luck. I think by default tensorflow uses all cpu cores. I am not sure if\n I am the only one facing performance issues..\n\n \u2014\n You are receiving this because you were mentioned.\n Reply to this email directly, view it on GitHub\n &lt;<a class=\"issue-link js-issue-link\" data-error-text=\"Failed to load issue title\" data-id=\"117313178\" data-permission-text=\"Issue title is private\" data-url=\"https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/254\" href=\"https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/254#issuecomment-321096131\">#254 (comment)</a>&gt;,\n or mute the thread\n &lt;<a href=\"https://github.com/notifications/unsubscribe-auth/AAKZGVAOvcaBmv2UIpysKjR2CJqXKagtks5sWN02gaJpZM4Gjqny\">https://github.com/notifications/unsubscribe-auth/AAKZGVAOvcaBmv2UIpysKjR2CJqXKagtks5sWN02gaJpZM4Gjqny</a>&gt;\n .\n</div>\n<div class=\"email-fragment\"></div>\n</div>", "body_text": "My experience was similar - Python was painfully slow\n\u2026\nOn 8 Aug 2017 11:12 pm, \"Kranthi\" ***@***.***> wrote:\n @danbri <https://github.com/danbri> @samjabrahams\n <https://github.com/samjabrahams>\n\n This is reply to @samjabrahams <https://github.com/samjabrahams> comment\n on Mar 17, 2016.
