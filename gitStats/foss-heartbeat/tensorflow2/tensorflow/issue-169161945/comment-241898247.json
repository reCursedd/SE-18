I think it would really speed up one of my projects. Is there any new progress? Are you planning to include this on the next release of TensorFlow? What about basic math functions such as <code>tf.exp()</code>, <code>tf.complex_abs()</code>?</p>\n<p>Thanks again!</p>", "body_text": "@ibab , @sbrodeur , thank you so much for working on this.
