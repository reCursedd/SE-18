Basically, there's no good way to distinguish between a put that took too long and a blocking put.\nStaging tests now simply count the number of iterations before a timeout of 1s occurs on the signalling queue. This should mean that:\n\nThe test case is less brittle around what is considered a block vs  the putting thread not being able to keep up.\nBoth stage_op_test and map_stage_op_test take slightly longer, ~2.5s vs ~1s, to run on an uncontended system..\n\nAlso simplified the tests cases in general.\n/cc @ekelsen @jhseu I saw #10516 and the duration of test runs (~30s on your test systems vs ~1s on my laptop) made me reconsider the duration on the blocking timeout. I've upped it 20X from 50ms to 1s.\nIn an ideal world, the test cases wouldn't depend on a timeout when running -- if you can suggest a different method of testing blocking puts and gets, please let me know.\nI also relooked at the multi-threaded code in the StagingArea, but I think the standard producer/consumer queue has been implemented correctly.\nI hope this helps.", "merged": true, "mergeable": null, "rebaseable": null, "mergeable_state": "unknown", "merged_by": {"login": "martinwicke", "id": 577277, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjU3NzI3Nw==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/577277?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/martinwicke", "html_url": "https://github.com/martinwicke", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/martinwicke/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/martinwicke/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/martinwicke/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/martinwicke/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/martinwicke/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/martinwicke/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/martinwicke/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/martinwicke/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/martinwicke/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "comments": 16, "review_comments": 0, "maintainer_can_modify": false, "commits": 2, "additions": 94, "deletions": 96, "changed_files": 3}
