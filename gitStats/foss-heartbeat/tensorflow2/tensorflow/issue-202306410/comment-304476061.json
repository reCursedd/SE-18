An LU decomposition for rectangular matrices is also very important similar to Scipy and MKL.\n\n \u2014\n You are receiving this because you commented.\n Reply to this email directly, view it on GitHub, or mute the thread.\n</div>\n<div class=\"email-fragment\"></div>\n</div>", "body_text": "Both would be useful - my current use case is for square matrices.
