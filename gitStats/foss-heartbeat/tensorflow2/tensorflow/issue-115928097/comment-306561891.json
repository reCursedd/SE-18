I did a pull with recursive-submodule still it has the same issues. And it has the same issue without --config = sycl. In fact I am facing the same issue when I do a git pull from tensorflow main project. I dont think this is linked with openCL, its some issues with the way I am doing the pull. When I manually download the project zip from your repo without git and compile, it compiles properly,  but then I get a segmentation fault. I have already raised this issue on your GIT project and we are talking there, I will give the updates related to the segmentation fault on that thread (no point duplicating things). Thanks for your response.</p>", "body_text": "@lukeiwanski : The issue as I understand is Bazel is trying to compile Protobuf and its not finding or downloading the sub directories.
