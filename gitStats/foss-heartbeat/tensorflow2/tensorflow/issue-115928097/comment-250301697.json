This sounds very good &amp; promising! I will definitely have a look at ComputeCpp then. I am really looking forward to OpenCL support for TensorFlow, because this offers a lot of new possiblities for robotics (which is the field where I am researching and using TensorFlow for deep learning applications). I will at least have a look at early releases and try to test / debug. We have some Intel Chips plus a number of ARM CPUs that are waiting for tests ;)</p>", "body_text": "@benoitsteiner thank you very much for the clarification & sorry for my misinformation!
