Unfortunately we had similar internal changes at about the same time. I noticed you added is_training to the gradient op in nn_ops.cc. Is it to solve this \"shape not compatible\" problem? There is no gradient computation for inference (is_training = False), in other words, is_training is not applicable to the gradient op. So adding it is a bit confusing to me. Could you explain why it is needed (or how it solved the shape incompatible issue)? Thanks!</p>", "body_text": "Hi thuyen, thank you very much for your contribution and the help on testing.
