We are working on the implementation of mkl optimized depthwise convolution, we won't have it merged before 1.9, expecting to have it implemented in the next release. Implementing the depthwise convolution in MKL will improve the performance of Conv2Dwithbias as it will receive input in the correct format. Can you also make sure you have the right environment variables as outlined in <a href=\"https://www.tensorflow.org/performance/performance_guide#optimizing_for_cpu\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.tensorflow.org/performance/performance_guide#optimizing_for_cpu</a>, especially setting KMP_BLOCKTIME=0</p>", "body_text": "@YijinLiu thanks for letting us know.
