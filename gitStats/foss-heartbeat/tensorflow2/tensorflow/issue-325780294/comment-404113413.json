Its not working.. finally i found a soloution which is called tensorflow for poets. It works quite well but not fast enough. Its done with native pip. But i killed it to because of the \"slow\" perfomance, but waaay better than you use the normal TF. Now i just use the rasberry pi as a \"connector\" and my tf runs on a vm server. Its  fast and stable and i can train my own models. I get a connection with a rest api (flask) and can send some picture to it from a smartglas or a mobilephone, notebook and so on. But thanks for help guys. The rasberry pi is not really good for it because the perfomance is really really bad.. maybe i am done somthing wrong but now it work with my solution :P</p>", "body_text": "@cy89  and @achalshah20 So guys, sorry for the late response... but i killed the project.
