I installed first Anaconda (5.0.1) and then MRO some month ago and all worked fine. Then when I tried to update R nothing worked anymore. I deinstalled everything and started from scratch.\nThe latest version of Anconda does not install correctly on Windows. I found a link and an advice to install Minconda instead. However when installing R I ran into new problems. I gave up and now run the Kerras part of my research on Ubunto.\n\nHowever, it would be interesting which versions of Anaconda, Python, TensorFlow and Keras work well in your case and when you installed.\n\nThank you\nCarsten\n\n\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..\nCarsten Lange, Ph.D.\nProfessor of Economics and Graduate Coordinator\nCalifornia State University\n3801 west Temple Ave.\nPomona, CA 91768\nPhone: +1 (909) 869 3843\nEmail: clange@cpp.edu\n\nFrom: wt-huang &lt;notifications@github.com&gt;\nSent: Friday, September 28, 2018 6:37 PM\nTo: tensorflow/tensorflow &lt;tensorflow@noreply.github.com&gt;\nCc: Carsten Lange &lt;clange@cpp.edu&gt;; Mention &lt;mention@noreply.github.com&gt;\nSubject: Re: [tensorflow/tensorflow] Installing Kerras on R/Windows (<a class=\"issue-link js-issue-link\" data-error-text=\"Failed to load issue title\" data-id=\"363346541\" data-permission-text=\"Issue title is private\" data-url=\"https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/22487\" href=\"https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/22487\">#22487</a>)\n\n\nI have installed Keras/R on Windows without any errors.\n\n\u2014\nYou are receiving this because you were mentioned.\nReply to this email directly, view it on GitHub&lt;<a href=\"https://na01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Ftensorflow%2Ftensorflow%2Fissues%2F22487%23issuecomment-425604925&amp;data=02%7C01%7Cclange%40cpp.edu%7C9d574ba4e0744669e11d08d625ac062c%7C164ba61e39ec4f5d89ffaa1f00a521b4%7C0%7C0%7C636737818329140866&amp;sdata=F1y%2F2mv%2BFN5MgpEL%2F%2F8SOesgt0svWqjYRFTZEkwAtfk%3D&amp;reserved=0\">https://na01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Ftensorflow%2Ftensorflow%2Fissues%2F22487%23issuecomment-425604925&amp;data=02%7C01%7Cclange%40cpp.edu%7C9d574ba4e0744669e11d08d625ac062c%7C164ba61e39ec4f5d89ffaa1f00a521b4%7C0%7C0%7C636737818329140866&amp;sdata=F1y%2F2mv%2BFN5MgpEL%2F%2F8SOesgt0svWqjYRFTZEkwAtfk%3D&amp;reserved=0</a>&gt;, or mute the thread&lt;<a href=\"https://na01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fnotifications%2Funsubscribe-auth%2FAePQqHYJgVaXZr2u0zxw9BggSLHwjhMIks5ufs6vgaJpZM4W3kye&amp;data=02%7C01%7Cclange%40cpp.edu%7C9d574ba4e0744669e11d08d625ac062c%7C164ba61e39ec4f5d89ffaa1f00a521b4%7C0%7C0%7C636737818329140866&amp;sdata=tfcZjL6CYJz0OpPwB%2BfFCcqG26ZyiRdGbyfl0JyAidk%3D&amp;reserved=0\">https://na01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fnotifications%2Funsubscribe-auth%2FAePQqHYJgVaXZr2u0zxw9BggSLHwjhMIks5ufs6vgaJpZM4W3kye&amp;data=02%7C01%7Cclange%40cpp.edu%7C9d574ba4e0744669e11d08d625ac062c%7C164ba61e39ec4f5d89ffaa1f00a521b4%7C0%7C0%7C636737818329140866&amp;sdata=tfcZjL6CYJz0OpPwB%2BfFCcqG26ZyiRdGbyfl0JyAidk%3D&amp;reserved=0</a>&gt;.</div>", "body_text": "Hi Wt-Huang,\n\nI had the same experience.
