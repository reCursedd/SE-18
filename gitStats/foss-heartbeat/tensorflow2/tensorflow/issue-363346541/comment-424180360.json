Thanks for the fast reply.  Yes, Ioaded Keras with library(keras) and the first command executed well. However, only keras_model_sequential() worked other commands did not. E.g.., the second one I mentioned and also \"use_session_with_seed(2018)\" did not work. I was not surprised, because Keras seems to require tensorflow=\"1.10.1\" and I used  tensorflow=\"1.10.0\" instead, which was kind of a hack.</p>", "body_text": "@ymodak .
