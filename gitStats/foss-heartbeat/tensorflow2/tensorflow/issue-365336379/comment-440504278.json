And if we make it under tensorflow root path, like: make -f tensorflow/lite/tools/make/Makefile TARGET=android TARGET_ARCH=armv7 TARGET_TOOLCHAIN_PREFIX=/ndk_standalone_tc/p19/arm/bin/arm-linux-androideabi- all -j4.<br>\nIt should generate a static library under tensorflow/lite/tools/make/gen/android_armv7/lib/ named libtensorflow-lite.a .<br>\nHowever, we found this static library has some performance issue. We somehow managed to bazel build //tensorflow/lite/tools/benchmark:benchmark_model. We examine a tflite by this binary program, then examine the same tflite by the static library we built above. And we see big inference time difference, like 400ms(libtensorflow-lite.a) and 80ms(benchmark_model). So, not so sure if this makefile creates a desirable library or not.<br>\nAll in all, I think we need a official way to generate static library for tflite.
