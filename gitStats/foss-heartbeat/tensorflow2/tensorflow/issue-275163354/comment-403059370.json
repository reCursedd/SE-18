Are there any official Tensorflow documents about using the Tensorboard under tf.keras? So far, I only found lots of instructions about using Tensorboard by Keras in a pre-defined way. But I want to personalized my own Tensorboard data, e.g., my own intermediate results, my own defined scalars or histograms, excluding some Keras pre-defined histograms; so far, I do not find any instructions about that. If there are not any, will Tensorflow people update the guidance later? Thank you.</p>", "body_text": "@facaiy Thank you for your quick response.
