Since the above list does not include the gradient files, it would still be required to code all the gradients using ops from these apis.  So yeah this should give all the ops required to build the backpropagation logic into java. I asked particularly about the gradients because I think at present client languages like python impelement all the gradients themselves(by calling and combining the normal ops) instead of calling the c core. So at present in Java, although you can call all the ops using the 'OperationBuilder' but you can't get the gradients that way. Thanks.</p>", "body_text": "@karllessard yes that's awesome.
