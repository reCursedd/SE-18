So I agree that the Categorical probabilities must all sum to 1.0, however, in this instance, I am only selecting one of those values to be used for backpropagation, so only that particular column should update.  The normalization of the distribution that the value was drawn should not affect this at all.  I'll see if I can come up with a fix and contribute it!</p>", "body_text": "Thanks for the respone! @langmore, I don't think that could explain this particular problem.
