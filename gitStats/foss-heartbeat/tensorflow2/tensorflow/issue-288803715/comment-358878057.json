My Friday looks a bit weird but I will try to get to this and have some response (like an update :-) on progress and what I am finding and thinking) before EOD Monday 22-JAN.  A complexity is loading the graph vs. the code and the object detection code is not maintained by the TensorFlow team.  I will see if I can discern something from the data I collect.  I am looking to setup a decent inference test and while this may not be it, the outcome may be useful to you and others.</p>", "body_text": "@louisquinn  Thank you.
