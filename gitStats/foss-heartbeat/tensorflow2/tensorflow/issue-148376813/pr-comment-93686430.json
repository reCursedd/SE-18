The goal of the problem is to fit a\n probabilistic model which assigns probabilities to sentences. It does so by\n predicting next words in a text given a history of previous words. For this\n-purpose we will use the Penn Tree Bank (PTB) dataset, which is a popular\n-benchmark for measuring quality of these models, whilst being small and\n-relatively fast to train.\n+purpose we will use the [Penn Tree Bank](http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~treebank/)", "path": "tensorflow/g3doc/tutorials/recurrent/index.md", "position": 7, "original_position": 7, "commit_id": "845b54a843a8a307fc0621a3d193247ff0f46c88", "original_commit_id": "845b54a843a8a307fc0621a3d193247ff0f46c88", "user": {"login": "gunan", "id": 7946809, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjc5NDY4MDk=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/7946809?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/gunan", "html_url": "https://github.com/gunan", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/gunan/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/gunan/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/gunan/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/gunan/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/gunan/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/gunan/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/gunan/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/gunan/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/gunan/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "body": "Fixed at master by #6373", "created_at": "2016-12-22T19:52:15Z", "updated_at": "2016-12-22T19:52:15Z", "html_url": "https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/pull/1944#discussion_r93686430", "pull_request_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/tensorflow/tensorflow/pulls/1944", "author_association": "MEMBER", "_links": {"self": {"href": "https://api.github.com/repos/tensorflow/tensorflow/pulls/comments/93686430"}, "html": {"href": "https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/pull/1944#discussion_r93686430"}, "pull_request": {"href": "https://api.github.com/repos/tensorflow/tensorflow/pulls/1944"}}, "body_html": "<p>Fixed at master by <a class=\"issue-link js-issue-link\" data-error-text=\"Failed to load issue title\" data-id=\"196194986\" data-permission-text=\"Issue title is private\" data-url=\"https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/6373\" data-hovercard-type=\"pull_request\" data-hovercard-url=\"/tensorflow/tensorflow/pull/6373/hovercard\" href=\"https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/pull/6373\">#6373</a></p>", "body_text": "Fixed at master by #6373", "in_reply_to_id": 93684032}
