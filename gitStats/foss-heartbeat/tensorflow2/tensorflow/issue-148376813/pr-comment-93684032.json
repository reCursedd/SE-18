The goal of the problem is to fit a\n probabilistic model which assigns probabilities to sentences. It does so by\n predicting next words in a text given a history of previous words. For this\n-purpose we will use the Penn Tree Bank (PTB) dataset, which is a popular\n-benchmark for measuring quality of these models, whilst being small and\n-relatively fast to train.\n+purpose we will use the [Penn Tree Bank](http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~treebank/)", "path": "tensorflow/g3doc/tutorials/recurrent/index.md", "position": 7, "original_position": 7, "commit_id": "845b54a843a8a307fc0621a3d193247ff0f46c88", "original_commit_id": "845b54a843a8a307fc0621a3d193247ff0f46c88", "user": {"login": "dydokamil", "id": 18383952, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE4MzgzOTUy", "avatar_url": "https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/18383952?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/dydokamil", "html_url": "https://github.com/dydokamil", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dydokamil/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dydokamil/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dydokamil/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dydokamil/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dydokamil/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dydokamil/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dydokamil/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dydokamil/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dydokamil/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "body": "The requested URL /~treebank/ was not found on this server.", "created_at": "2016-12-22T19:37:21Z", "updated_at": "2016-12-22T19:37:21Z", "html_url": "https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/pull/1944#discussion_r93684032", "pull_request_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/tensorflow/tensorflow/pulls/1944", "author_association": "NONE", "_links": {"self": {"href": "https://api.github.com/repos/tensorflow/tensorflow/pulls/comments/93684032"}, "html": {"href": "https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/pull/1944#discussion_r93684032"}, "pull_request": {"href": "https://api.github.com/repos/tensorflow/tensorflow/pulls/1944"}}, "body_html": "<p>The requested URL /~treebank/ was not found on this server.</p>", "body_text": "The requested URL /~treebank/ was not found on this server."}
