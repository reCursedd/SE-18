That works and is about 10x as fast as the np.matmul() and I do see spikes in the GPU compute usage. In this case the random numbers were generated in the GPU, which is fine for this toy example. For real tasks, the inputs will be generated by the CPU and I'm hoping that the computations will be way more than the rate of feeding inputs - will pay more with the tf.dataset API. The CUDA error might be a bug - I don't see it for smaller input shapes.</p>", "body_text": "Thanks @Benyuel!
