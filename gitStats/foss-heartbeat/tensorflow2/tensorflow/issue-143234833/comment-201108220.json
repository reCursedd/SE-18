I think our disagreement about this particular section stems from our thoughts on what the primary purpose of this tutorial should be. Correct me if I'm wrong, but from what I gather your opinion is that the most important aspect of this tutorial is to teach users how to design and setup a model that A, works and B. is as efficient as possible. I completely respect this, and it is an important skill for anyone who's learning machine learning to get a grasp of. My opinion, in contrast, is that this tutorial's primary goal should be to teach the fundamental concepts and frequently-used components of the API that one would expect to see in a convolutional neural network. In this way, it can serve as an alternative way of learning the API- showing users how different components are used in practice instead of only having the plain documentation.</p>\n<p>Again- I think your suggestion is valid, but the commit as it stands just removes any mention of dropout anywhere in the tutorial. I don't like the idea of completely removing valuable educational material about the API for the sake of teaching users that dropout isn't always necessary.</p>\n<p>Perhaps this change could be bundled with the aforementioned separate dropout tutorial :)</p>", "body_text": "@fayeshine Absolutely- I think a separate tutorial with a targeted example showcasing when and how dropout is useful would be a great resource for those learning about neural network models.
