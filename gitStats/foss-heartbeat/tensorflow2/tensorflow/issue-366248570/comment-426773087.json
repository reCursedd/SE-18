I understand your frustration. We spend a lot of time listening to the community and sometimes we fail to get it correct.  A lot of people want easy multi-gpu and the best way to do that was via Estimator or Keras that can then handle all the little details.  For some top researchers, mostly in performance, they would use the tf_cnn_benchmarks approaches and build from them to add custom logic to some some really neat tricks.
