It has [a loop which depends on the length of the inputs](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/models/rnn/rnn.py#L86). Plus, `max_sequence_length` is not a const; instead it's just the scalar of the `sequence_length` parameter, which can be and is `None` by default. So, by default, the unrolling is not truncated. Correct me if I misread the code.\n2. @ebrevdo I understand the computational saving motivation. However, returning zeros is logically very different from returning the state at `sequence_length` (if provided). The former is just wrong. Again, please correct if I misread the code.\n\nThanks.\n"}
