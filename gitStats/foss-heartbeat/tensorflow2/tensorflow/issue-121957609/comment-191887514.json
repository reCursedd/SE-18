I got \"correct recognition\" however, I didn't divide the RGB values with 128 in the tensorflow_jni.cc. The division part looks like what we do in standardizing a random variable that is normally distributed? So since I didn't divide it with 128, does it mean that the recognition is still happening but since it's not standardized, it may fail for some cases?</p>", "body_text": "@petewarden Hi Pete, so I loaded the newer inception model in the android demo with the input size of 299 and mean of 128.
