I'm working through it, attempting to use my retrained graph with the image_classify.py file, and I'm having issues with reading the graph back.

The operation, 'softmax', does not exist in the graph.\"</code></p>\n<p>Since the \"output_graph.pb\" file should in theory be the same as the \"classify_image_graph_def.pb\" file, is there a command that I am missing to make the \"output_graph.pb\" file readable by the image_classify.py file?</p>\n<p>Thanks</p>\n<p>Oren</p>", "body_text": "@petewarden Thank you so much for providing this tutorial.
