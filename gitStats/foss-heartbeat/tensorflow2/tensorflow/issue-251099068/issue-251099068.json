Currently one can only assign values to tensors by creating variables. Why is there no simple assignment op for tensors directly? An example would be a case where we simply zero-out a column of a tensor, for example, at some point in execution. In order to do that now we would either need to create a variable, or a series of slicing and concatenation ops (along with creating a new tensor containing the zero-ed out column).</p>\n<p>Thanks!</p>", "body_text": "Hi,\nI've been wondering why there are no simple tensor assignment ops.
