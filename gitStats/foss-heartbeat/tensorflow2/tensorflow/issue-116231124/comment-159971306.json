I am able to compile executables and .so files from within the tensorflow build environment, but when I take the compiled so file and link it into my project with my own cmake build environment, the resulting program does compile but crashes on startup at some Tensorflow Kernel related method.  How can I see what compile options bazel is using?  I suspect there is some sort of incompatibility there.
