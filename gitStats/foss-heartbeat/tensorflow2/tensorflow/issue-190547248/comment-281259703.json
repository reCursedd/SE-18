For each time step of LSTM there is a memory cell value <strong><em>c</em></strong>, a hidden state <strong><em>h</em></strong>, and an output <strong><em>y</em></strong>. So what you were suggesting is that the <strong><em>outputs</em></strong> returned by dynamic RNN contain <strong><em>h</em></strong> rather than <em><strong>y</strong></em> for each step? Would that also mean the returned <strong><em>output_states</em></strong> is actually <strong><em>outputs</em></strong>[-1]? Thank you.</p>", "body_text": "@ebrevdo  May I ask a question?
