I think i'm not wanting tensorflow to do some backward shape inference or things like that. What I'm confused about is that how setting static shape can have an influence on gradients computing. Because without that line, the code works pretty well. What I only hope is that line can help me know more about the static shape of <code>a_</code></p>", "body_text": "@concretevitamin thanks for reply.
