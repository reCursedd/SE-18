I have checked the code from tensorflow, it not difficult to understand. I think based on the detailed algorithm from the paper, I could fix this and will report within 1 or 2 days.<br>\nI have to say that I really love this paper. Moving from softmax to sparsemax change a lot of concepts: soft =&gt; hard, nonlinear =&gt; linear. I hope that in the future, it can be combined with relational deep learning and stochastic discrete model like REBAR and RELAX to enable reasoning over discrete structures.</p>", "body_text": "@AndreasMadsen Thank you for replying.
