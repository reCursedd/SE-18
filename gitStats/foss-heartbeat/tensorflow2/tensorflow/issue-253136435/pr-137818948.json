There is a small inconsistency when dealing with TFE tensors now in that for the string data type, a copy of the provided `TF_Tensor` is created, whereas for others types that's not the case. This can be problematic when users of the API attempt to use the underlying tensor buffer directly (e.g., to read values of specific elements). The problem could potentially be alleviated if the same memory layout is used for string `TF_Tensor`s and `tensorflow::Tensor`s. I'm not sure why that's not the case and I'm also not sure what the memory layout for string tensors is internally (could someone provide some insight into that please?).\r\n2. The above-mentioned problem could be partially alleviated by providing a TFE function for obtaining a byte array representation of the `i`th element in the flattened (row-major) tensor.

This fix resolves the issues specific to string tensors and the eager execution API, but one issue related to #12612 still remains.
