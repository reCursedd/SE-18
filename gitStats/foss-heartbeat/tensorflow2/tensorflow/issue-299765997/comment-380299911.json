And also I think the API for using the trained model in Java a much complex to use, I think it can be better to divide the usage into steps, like 1. load 2. calling the API for recognition 3. release resources. But now when loading we must do a lot of work, and also when doing recognition also do a lot of works, so then there is some job can incapsulate inside the API no need the user do the duplicate job. So it will be the API be handy and friendly. Thanks!</p>", "body_text": "@asimshankar OK, the question almost has been answered, we hope the TensorFlow support GPU for Java on windows platform.
