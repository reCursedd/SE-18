Is there any chance you could make the 'diff' minimal, with only the code changes that you really needed to do, but not mutating the state of the cells? It would make it a lot easier to approve quickly.<br>\nAlso, I don't believe any of my uses of xrange are performance-critical. If it helps readability to just turn them into 'range' for bot python 2.7 and 3.0, then I'd marginally prefer that.</p>", "body_text": "Hi @lzlarryli, thanks for your help with this.
