I couldn't dial in that balance with the GPU taking such long pauses. That said, my GPU usage was also extremely low, even when I seemed to be filling memory up (growth set to true, etc.) I never got above 12%. Still, I am much more worried about the batching speed issue. This bug, if it is indeed a bug, means we are still stuck loading tabular data via tfrecord/protobuf if we want decent performance. Its a problem because its more than 90% of our ML use cases (image data is fun, but a huge portion of ML is just strait up data). That said, I'm not complaining overall, Tensorflow is an amazing achievement and it gets better every day.
