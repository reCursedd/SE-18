In your preliminary demo for fast-RCNN you used Selective Search for ROI extraction. I've been searching for an implementation of EdgeBoxes in python but couldn't find anything available without the requirement of a MATLAB license. I'm assuming that you also couldn't find an implementation. Or did you have another reason for taking Selective Search?</p>", "body_text": "@zplizzi thanks for sharing your code here.
