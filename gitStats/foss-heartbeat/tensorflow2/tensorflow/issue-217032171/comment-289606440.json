I personally was trying for x64 arch but is good to know. Do you know if is possible to select GCC as the compiler by CMake and build with MSYS2 for instance with <code>-march=native</code> enabled or is it too much of a hack? I know other compilers like Intel's allow SSE4.2 for instance but MSVC is a bit limited. Thanks a lot!</p>", "body_text": "@guschmue Well noted.
