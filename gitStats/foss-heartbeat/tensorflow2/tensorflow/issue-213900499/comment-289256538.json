It actually pulled my main file, but i have everything wrote down. I added a few specs extra for VM for tensorflow &amp; cudnn to use than i really need. Was trying to visualize the behaviour. Thought it would be useful support from some of the comments. Stereograms looks good. No need for border -&gt; border. Doubles was extra  not needed. Wanted it to be an asset for the future. Are there any other offsets that need fixing? I think most everything was accounted for except a few fft maybe to deal with n%. Probably need to know how to reverse the sequence to correct anythimg still being offset. Probably just a few more calculations to complete the math lib, but you may have already account for that issue. But think this pr will be good. Std:: should already cover everything else. Let me know if there are any other pr i need to close out or any questions. Dont think i opened any other pr myself. Lost track as this ended up covering a lot of more than i expected. Thank You for allowing me to be a part of this.</p>", "body_text": "Go ahead and update current and fix the things i missed as you need to.
