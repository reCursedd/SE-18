Yes I would really like some detail on how to do the no-new-op version of separable conv.  The depthwise part seems easy, just with a 1x1x1xN kernel; I couldn't figure out a good way to do the pure spatial conv. I can try to do a native version later if this shows good performance.</p>", "body_text": "@girving Thank you!
