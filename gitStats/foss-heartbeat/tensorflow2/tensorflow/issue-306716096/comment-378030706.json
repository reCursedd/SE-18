It would be great to get nightly builds of libtensorflow.so and libtensorflow_framework.so that are cross-compiled ala the raspberry pi builds.  I'm really looking to get these libs extend support for Tensorflow on ARM in other languages (e.g. C#).  Ideally, the nightly libtensorflow build would produce bits for cpu-armhf and cpu-aarm64 to start with.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://ci.tensorflow.org/view/Nightly/job/nightly-libtensorflow/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://ci.tensorflow.org/view/Nightly/job/nightly-libtensorflow/</a></p>", "body_text": "Thanks @gunan and @johndeppe.
