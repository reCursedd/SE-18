I already wrote a tensorflow graph myself and make it work. The <code>Estimator</code> class seems not having a model_type as an argument; i.e., I can't choose what kind of cell to pass in as my network's major component. And it does not have predict_proba function either. Thanks!</p>", "body_text": "@ilblackdragon thanks for your response. I already wrote a tensorflow graph myself and make it work.
