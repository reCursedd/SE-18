You need to be careful to distinguish variables from all other nodes in a TensorFlow graph. E.g., when you write this name above:</p>\n<p>scope_1/InnerScope/tile_batch_1/Reshape_1:0</p>\n<p>This is not a variable, this is just a node from the reshape op. Every node in the TF graph has its own unique name. When you reshape the same variable twice, for example, you'll get 2 different names for 2 different reshape nodes. It's just the variables that are shared. I hope this clarifies the confusion a bit!</p>", "body_text": "Hi @malsulaimi , thanks for writing.
