I finally figured it out by comparing the GraphDefs. I use slightly different naming conventions than the Python API (e.g., with respect to proper casing names, etc.), but in the end I created a small script for post-processing the GraphDef and mapping the names. The bug ended up being something ridiculous (i.e., forgetting to exit a gradient state context), but it was hard to trace down. Thank you very much for all the ideas! :)</p>", "body_text": "@skye Thanks for all the tips. I finally figured it out by comparing the GraphDefs.
