Be sure to convey here why it's a bug in TensorFlow or a feature request.\r\nI have some problems in importing the Tensorflow in Python. I am using Ubuntu 16.04. I am trying to perform Deepfix experiments. \r\nAs given on the Deepfix website [https://bitbucket.org/iiscseal/deepfix](url) I have tried running the script\r\nsource init.sh\r\nbut it gives me the error. Here is my output to the command\r\n\r\n`~/iiscseal-deepfix-7a4f0b6122d4$ source init.sh\r\nSetting up a new virtual environment...\r\n\r\n\r\nCondaValueError: prefix already exists: /home/ujjval/miniconda2/envs/deepfix\r\n\r\ndone!\r\nRequirement already satisfied: subprocess32 in /home/ujjval/miniconda2/envs/deepfix/lib/python2.7/site-packages (3.5.0)\r\nRequirement already satisfied: tensorflow-gpu==1.0.1 in /home/ujjval/miniconda2/envs/deepfix/lib/python2.7/site-packages (1.0.1)\r\nRequirement already satisfied: regex in /home/ujjval/miniconda2/envs/deepfix/lib/python2.7/site-packages (2018.2.21)\r\nRequirement already satisfied: mock>=2.0.0 in /home/ujjval/miniconda2/envs/deepfix/lib/python2.7/site-packages (from tensorflow-gpu==1.0.1) (2.0.0)\r\nRequirement already satisfied: six>=1.10.0 in /home/ujjval/miniconda2/envs/deepfix/lib/python2.7/site-packages (from tensorflow-gpu==1.0.1) (1.11.0)\r\nRequirement already satisfied: numpy>=1.11.0 in /home/ujjval/miniconda2/envs/deepfix/lib/python2.7/site-packages (from tensorflow-gpu==1.0.1) (1.14.3)\r\nRequirement already satisfied: protobuf>=3.1.0 in /home/ujjval/miniconda2/envs/deepfix/lib/python2.7/site-packages (from tensorflow-gpu==1.0.1) (3.5.2.post1)\r\nRequirement already satisfied: wheel in /home/ujjval/miniconda2/envs/deepfix/lib/python2.7/site-packages (from tensorflow-gpu==1.0.1) (0.31.0)\r\nRequirement already satisfied: funcsigs>=1; python_version < \"3.3\" in /home/ujjval/miniconda2/envs/deepfix/lib/python2.7/site-packages (from mock>=2.0.0->tensorflow-gpu==1.0.1) (1.0.2)\r\nRequirement already satisfied: pbr>=0.11 in /home/ujjval/miniconda2/envs/deepfix/lib/python2.7/site-packages (from mock>=2.0.0->tensorflow-gpu==1.0.1) (4.0.2)\r\nRequirement already satisfied: setuptools in /home/ujjval/miniconda2/envs/deepfix/lib/python2.7/site-packages (from protobuf>=3.1.0->tensorflow-gpu==1.0.1) (39.1.0)\r\nmkdir: cannot create directory \u2018temp\u2019: File exists\r\nmkdir: cannot create directory \u2018logs\u2019: File exists\r\nmkdir: cannot create directory \u2018data/results\u2019: File exists\r\n\r\nDownloading DeepFix dataset...\r\nPreprocessing DeepFix dataset...\r\nMake sure that your tensorflow is version 1.0.1 before proceeding, checking your tensorflow version now!\r\n\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"<string>\", line 1, in <module>\r\n  File \"/home/ujjval/miniconda2/envs/deepfix/lib/python2.7/site-packages/tensorflow/__init__.py\", line 24, in <module>\r\n    from tensorflow.python import *\r\n  File \"/home/ujjval/miniconda2/envs/deepfix/lib/python2.7/site-packages/tensorflow/python/__init__.py\", line 72, in <module>\r\n    raise ImportError(msg)\r\nImportError: Traceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"/home/ujjval/miniconda2/envs/deepfix/lib/python2.7/site-packages/tensorflow/python/__init__.py\", line 61, in <module>\r\n    from tensorflow.python import pywrap_tensorflow\r\n  File \"/home/ujjval/miniconda2/envs/deepfix/lib/python2.7/site-packages/tensorflow/python/pywrap_tensorflow.py\", line 28, in <module>\r\n    _pywrap_tensorflow = swig_import_helper()\r\n  File \"/home/ujjval/miniconda2/envs/deepfix/lib/python2.7/site-packages/tensorflow/python/pywrap_tensorflow.py\", line 24, in swig_import_helper\r\n    _mod = imp.load_module('_pywrap_tensorflow', fp, pathname, description)\r\nImportError: libcudart.so.8.0: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory\r\n\r\n\r\nFailed to load the native TensorFlow runtime.\r\n\r\nSee https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/g3doc/get_started/os_setup.md#import_error\r\n\r\nfor some common reasons and solutions.
