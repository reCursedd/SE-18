Sorry to bug you in another thread, but we also have come up to this issue. When testing our little app on my friends phone (which is also Galaxy S6) we are also getting this error (SIGSEV 11 when ImageUtils.convertYUV420ToARGB8888 is executed) and this is happening only sometimes.</p>\n<p>Apart of this, twisted bitmap is obtained when we are showing to user what was examined by TF. See in attachement. This only happens on S6. Regarding sensor orientation, we are getting same rotation value as on another phones, so this probably is not the root cause. Maybe some issue with armeabi-v7a and arm64 compatibility of .so libraries? I only compiled armeabi-v7a version assuming that they will work properly on arm64 (on S6) as well.</p>\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/19685528/23383936/eed2cb9e-fd48-11e6-83f7-7c45daa21912.png\"><img src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/19685528/23383936/eed2cb9e-fd48-11e6-83f7-7c45daa21912.png\" alt=\"s6\" style=\"max-width:100%;\"></a></p>\n<p>On the other devices which are available to us for testing: Galaxy S5, Xiaomi Mi4, Galaxy J5 and Galaxy Tab S2 9.7, it works fine and displays correct snapshot.</p>", "body_text": "@andrewharp Hi Andrew, long time no see :).
