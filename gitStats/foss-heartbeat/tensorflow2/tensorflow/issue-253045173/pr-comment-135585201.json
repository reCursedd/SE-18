Nodes in the graph represent mathematical operations,\n+  while the graph edges represent the multidimensional data arrays (tensors)\n+  communicated between them. The flexible architecture allows you to deploy\n+  computation to one or more CPUs or GPUs in a desktop, server, or mobile device\n+  with a single API. TensorFlow was originally developed by researchers and\n+  engineers working on the Google Brain Team within Google's Machine Intelligence\n+  research organization for the purposes of conducting machine learning and deep\n+  neural networks research, but the system is general enough to be applicable in\n+  a wide variety of other domains as well.\n+\n+grade: devel # must be 'stable' to release into candidate/stable channels\n+confinement: devmode # use 'strict' once you have the right plugs and slots\n+\n+parts:\n+  tensorflow:\n+    source: https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/archive/$SNAPCRAFT_PROJECT_VERSION.tar.gz\n+    plugin: python\n+    python-version: python2\n+\n+    build-packages:\n+      - openjdk-8-jdk", "path": "tensorflow/tools/ci_build/snap/snapcraft.yaml", "position": 26, "original_position": 26, "commit_id": "d5cd86db4f53b486b97adb80b2a887d7ec93d5a0", "original_commit_id": "d5cd86db4f53b486b97adb80b2a887d7ec93d5a0", "user": {"login": "gunan", "id": 7946809, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjc5NDY4MDk=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/7946809?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/gunan", "html_url": "https://github.com/gunan", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/gunan/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/gunan/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/gunan/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/gunan/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/gunan/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/gunan/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/gunan/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/gunan/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/gunan/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "body": "Also add these:\r\npython-dev (instead of python)\r\ngit (needed during configure, https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/tools/git/gen_git_source.py#L155)", "created_at": "2017-08-28T17:38:58Z", "updated_at": "2017-08-28T17:38:58Z", "html_url": "https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/pull/12607#discussion_r135585201", "pull_request_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/tensorflow/tensorflow/pulls/12607", "author_association": "MEMBER", "_links": {"self": {"href": "https://api.github.com/repos/tensorflow/tensorflow/pulls/comments/135585201"}, "html": {"href": "https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/pull/12607#discussion_r135585201"}, "pull_request": {"href": "https://api.github.com/repos/tensorflow/tensorflow/pulls/12607"}}, "body_html": "<p>Also add these:<br>\npython-dev (instead of python)<br>\ngit (needed during configure, <a href=\"https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/tools/git/gen_git_source.py#L155\">https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/tools/git/gen_git_source.py#L155</a>)</p>", "body_text": "Also add these:\npython-dev (instead of python)\ngit (needed during configure, https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/tools/git/gen_git_source.py#L155)", "in_reply_to_id": 135584208}
