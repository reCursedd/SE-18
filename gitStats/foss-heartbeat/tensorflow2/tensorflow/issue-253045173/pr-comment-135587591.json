Nodes in the graph represent mathematical operations,\n+  while the graph edges represent the multidimensional data arrays (tensors)\n+  communicated between them. The flexible architecture allows you to deploy\n+  computation to one or more CPUs or GPUs in a desktop, server, or mobile device\n+  with a single API. TensorFlow was originally developed by researchers and\n+  engineers working on the Google Brain Team within Google's Machine Intelligence\n+  research organization for the purposes of conducting machine learning and deep\n+  neural networks research, but the system is general enough to be applicable in\n+  a wide variety of other domains as well.\n+\n+grade: devel # must be 'stable' to release into candidate/stable channels\n+confinement: devmode # use 'strict' once you have the right plugs and slots\n+\n+parts:\n+  tensorflow:\n+    source: https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/archive/$SNAPCRAFT_PROJECT_VERSION.tar.gz\n+    plugin: python\n+    python-version: python2\n+\n+    build-packages:\n+      - openjdk-8-jdk\n+      - oracle-java8-installer\n+      - bazel\n+    build:\n+      pip install six numpy wheel \n+      cd tensorflow\n+      ./configure\n+      bazel build --config=opt //tensorflow/tools/pip_package:build_pip_package\n+      pip install /tmp/tensorflow_pkg/tensorflow-1.3.0-py2-none-any.whl", "path": "tensorflow/tools/ci_build/snap/snapcraft.yaml", "position": 34, "original_position": 34, "commit_id": "d5cd86db4f53b486b97adb80b2a887d7ec93d5a0", "original_commit_id": "d5cd86db4f53b486b97adb80b2a887d7ec93d5a0", "user": {"login": "av8ramit", "id": 5588272, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjU1ODgyNzI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/5588272?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/av8ramit", "html_url": "https://github.com/av8ramit", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/av8ramit/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/av8ramit/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/av8ramit/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/av8ramit/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/av8ramit/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/av8ramit/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/av8ramit/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/av8ramit/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/av8ramit/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "body": "So unfortunately no, I'll have to hardcode the version, but what I can do is modify the update_version script to update it during releases.", "created_at": "2017-08-28T17:48:28Z", "updated_at": "2017-08-28T17:48:28Z", "html_url": "https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/pull/12607#discussion_r135587591", "pull_request_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/tensorflow/tensorflow/pulls/12607", "author_association": "MEMBER", "_links": {"self": {"href": "https://api.github.com/repos/tensorflow/tensorflow/pulls/comments/135587591"}, "html": {"href": "https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/pull/12607#discussion_r135587591"}, "pull_request": {"href": "https://api.github.com/repos/tensorflow/tensorflow/pulls/12607"}}, "body_html": "<p>So unfortunately no, I'll have to hardcode the version, but what I can do is modify the update_version script to update it during releases.</p>", "body_text": "So unfortunately no, I'll have to hardcode the version, but what I can do is modify the update_version script to update it during releases.", "in_reply_to_id": 135385647}
