I user inception_v2 as a base network. During training, the batchsize=128. During testing, if the batchsize=128, everything is ok. However, if the batchsize is smaller than 128 the results are different. And the precision declines as the batchsize drops. If the batchsize=1, the network will failed. I also used inception_v3 and inception_v1, the same problems appered. However, if the base network is replaced with Alex network (tensorflow), everything goes well. I think I have not used slim or inception_v2 properly. Could you please give me some advices\uff1f</p>", "body_text": "@aselle Hi  Aselle, I encounter a similar problem.
