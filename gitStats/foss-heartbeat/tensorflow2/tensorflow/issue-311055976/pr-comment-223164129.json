Add a custom option to the configure.py that asks for the path of the avroc shared library on the system\n+2. Get support for cmake in bazel; which does seem to the case yet: https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/2532.\n+3. Use the cmake build chain for tensorflow -- this is experimental feature.\n+4.
