Essentially, `libavro.so` is reachable, e.g. through the library path `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`\n+\n+During the configure step in the TensorFlow set the environment variable AVRO_C_HOME to \"<full-path-to-your-cloned-avro-repo>/lang/c/build/avrolib/\"\n+\n+### Compilation and install of the avro library\n+A quick way to install it is as follows:\n+```\n+git clone https://github.com/apache/avro.git\n+cd avro/lang/c\n+mkdir -p build\n+cd build\n+cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=avrolib -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo -DTHREADSAFE=true\n+make\n+make test\n+make install\n+```\n+Note, that `make install` by default will place header files and library files into default places if you did not specify the `MAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX` directory.\n+\n+\n+### Why did we not add the compile and install of the avro library?\n+Several alternatives seemed to be harder to achieve this at that time\n+1. Lack of support for cmake in bazel; which does seem to the case yet: https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/2532.\n+2. Use the cmake build chain for tensorflow -- this is an experimental feature.\n+3. Port the CMake build file to bazel -- as has been done, e.g. for parquet.\n+\n+## Code examples\n+The code examples reside in the folder `avro/python/examples`. These examples are NOT part of the published artifact. However, `avro/python/utils` that contain helper methods that are also used by these examples have been added to the published artifact for convenience to run the examples and the tests.\n+\n+## Type mappings\n+We assume the following, enforced mapping between c/c++, avro, and numpy types\n+\n+| c/c++   | avro    | numpy   |\n+| ------- | ------- | ------- |\n+| bool    | boolean | bool    |\n+| int     | int     | int32   |\n+| long    | long    | int64   |\n+| float   | float   | float32 |\n+| double  | double  | float64 |\n+| string  | string  | bytes   |\n+| uint8*  | bytes   | bytes   |\n+\n+Note, when using python3 the `bytes` formatting in numpy may be astounding, however, see that\n+tensorflow decided not to include a separate type for string.", "path": "tensorflow/contrib/avro/README.md", "position": null, "original_position": 52, "commit_id": "bdf790d5c888e59d593230286edaaf5314daaee5", "original_commit_id": "09a504212e2aae7d13b25ebf572c1a93f226e89f", "user": {"login": "fraudies", "id": 1770877, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE3NzA4Nzc=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/1770877?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/fraudies", "html_url": "https://github.com/fraudies", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fraudies/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fraudies/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fraudies/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fraudies/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fraudies/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fraudies/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fraudies/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fraudies/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/fraudies/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "body": "Maybe the confusion is that I'm talking about the numpy type here?", "created_at": "2018-10-22T21:20:41Z", "updated_at": "2018-10-22T21:28:38Z", "html_url": "https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/pull/18224#discussion_r227142675", "pull_request_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/tensorflow/tensorflow/pulls/18224", "author_association": "NONE", "_links": {"self": {"href": "https://api.github.com/repos/tensorflow/tensorflow/pulls/comments/227142675"}, "html": {"href": "https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/pull/18224#discussion_r227142675"}, "pull_request": {"href": "https://api.github.com/repos/tensorflow/tensorflow/pulls/18224"}}, "body_html": "<p>Maybe the confusion is that I'm talking about the numpy type here?</p>", "body_text": "Maybe the confusion is that I'm talking about the numpy type here?", "in_reply_to_id": 226524686}
