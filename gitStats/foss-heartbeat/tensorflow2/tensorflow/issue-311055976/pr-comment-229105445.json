Essentially, `libavro.so` is reachable, e.g. through the library path `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`\n+\n+During the configure step in the TensorFlow set the environment variable AVRO_C_HOME to \"<full-path-to-your-cloned-avro-repo>/lang/c/build/avrolib/\"\n+\n+### Compilation and install of the avro library\n+A quick way to install it is as follows:\n+```\n+git clone https://github.com/apache/avro.git\n+cd avro/lang/c\n+mkdir -p build\n+cd build\n+cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=avrolib -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo -DTHREADSAFE=true\n+make\n+make test\n+make install\n+```\n+Note, that `make install` by default will place header files and library files into default places if you did not specify the `MAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX` directory.\n+\n+\n+### Why did we not add the compile and install of the avro library?\n+Several alternatives seemed to be harder to achieve this at that time\n+1. Lack of support for cmake in bazel; which does seem to the case yet: https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/2532.\n+2. Use the cmake build chain for tensorflow -- this is an experimental feature.\n+3. Port the CMake build file to bazel -- as has been done, e.g. for parquet.\n+\n+## Code examples\n+The code examples reside in the folder `avro/python/examples`. These examples are NOT part of the published artifact. However, `avro/python/utils` that contain helper methods that are also used by these examples have been added to the published artifact for convenience to run the examples and the tests.\n+\n+## Type mappings\n+We assume the following, enforced mapping between c/c++, avro, and numpy types\n+\n+| c/c++   | avro    | numpy   |\n+| ------- | ------- | ------- |\n+| bool    | boolean | bool    |\n+| int     | int     | int32   |\n+| long    | long    | int64   |\n+| float   | float   | float32 |\n+| double  | double  | float64 |\n+| string  | string  | string_ |\n+| uint8*  | bytes   | bytes_  |\n+\n+Note, that `string_` may resolve to different version. E.g. when using python3 `string_` resolves to `bytes` in numpy. This may be astounding.
