Where\n+  the `cell` performs computation at every timestep using the `raw_rnn` and\n+  the `decoder_fn` allows modelling of early stopping, output, state, and next\n+  input and context.\n+\n+  When training the user is expected to supply `inputs`. At every time step a\n+  slice of the supplied input is fed to the `decoder_fn`, which modifies and\n+  returns the input for the next time step.\n+\n+  `sequence_lengths` is optional an only used if the `decoder_fn` returns\n+  `None` for early stopping. `sequence_lengths` determines how many time steps\n+  to compute. `sequence_lengths` allows variable length samples in a batch by\n+  early stopping and is usually used when training. If `inputs` is not `None`\n+  and sequence_lengths=None` it is inferred from the `inputs` as the maximal\n+  possible sequence length.\n+", "path": "tensorflow/contrib/seq2seq/python/ops/seq2seq.py", "position": null, "original_position": 62, "commit_id": "cf9f5d32c2d618e7dd98fe222b92aec1a3cf9dd4", "original_commit_id": "b095937697db49cf2cad52a129d569e714a394f8", "user": {"login": "jihunchoi", "id": 1898501, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE4OTg1MDE=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/1898501?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/jihunchoi", "html_url": "https://github.com/jihunchoi", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jihunchoi/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jihunchoi/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jihunchoi/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jihunchoi/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jihunchoi/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jihunchoi/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jihunchoi/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jihunchoi/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jihunchoi/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "body": "By the way, isn't the parameter just named as `sequence_length` in `dynamic_rnn` and `rnn` implementation?\r\nI think naming it as `sequence_length`, instead of `sequence_lengths`, would be more consistent...", "created_at": "2016-11-21T03:47:53Z", "updated_at": "2016-11-30T17:47:01Z", "html_url": "https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/pull/4686#discussion_r88825554", "pull_request_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/tensorflow/tensorflow/pulls/4686", "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR", "_links": {"self": {"href": "https://api.github.com/repos/tensorflow/tensorflow/pulls/comments/88825554"}, "html": {"href": "https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/pull/4686#discussion_r88825554"}, "pull_request": {"href": "https://api.github.com/repos/tensorflow/tensorflow/pulls/4686"}}, "body_html": "<p>By the way, isn't the parameter just named as <code>sequence_length</code> in <code>dynamic_rnn</code> and <code>rnn</code> implementation?<br>\nI think naming it as <code>sequence_length</code>, instead of <code>sequence_lengths</code>, would be more consistent...</p>", "body_text": "By the way, isn't the parameter just named as sequence_length in dynamic_rnn and rnn implementation?\nI think naming it as sequence_length, instead of sequence_lengths, would be more consistent...", "in_reply_to_id": 88784468}
