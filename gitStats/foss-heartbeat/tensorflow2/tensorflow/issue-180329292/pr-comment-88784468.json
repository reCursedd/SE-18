Where\n+  the `cell` performs computation at every timestep using the `raw_rnn` and\n+  the `decoder_fn` allows modelling of early stopping, output, state, and next\n+  input and context.\n+\n+  When training the user is expected to supply `inputs`. At every time step a\n+  slice of the supplied input is fed to the `decoder_fn`, which modifies and\n+  returns the input for the next time step.\n+\n+  `sequence_lengths` is optional an only used if the `decoder_fn` returns\n+  `None` for early stopping. `sequence_lengths` determines how many time steps\n+  to compute. `sequence_lengths` allows variable length samples in a batch by\n+  early stopping and is usually used when training. If `inputs` is not `None`\n+  and sequence_lengths=None` it is inferred from the `inputs` as the maximal\n+  possible sequence length.\n+", "path": "tensorflow/contrib/seq2seq/python/ops/seq2seq.py", "position": null, "original_position": 62, "commit_id": "cf9f5d32c2d618e7dd98fe222b92aec1a3cf9dd4", "original_commit_id": "b095937697db49cf2cad52a129d569e714a394f8", "user": {"login": "lmthang", "id": 396613, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjM5NjYxMw==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/396613?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/lmthang", "html_url": "https://github.com/lmthang", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/lmthang/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/lmthang/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/lmthang/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/lmthang/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/lmthang/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/lmthang/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/lmthang/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/lmthang/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/lmthang/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "body": "I'd rewrite this paragraph as follows:\n  `sequence_lengths` is needed at training time, i.e., when `inputs` is not None, for dynamic unrolling.
