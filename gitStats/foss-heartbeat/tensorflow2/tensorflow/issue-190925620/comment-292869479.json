I confirmed that if the python session is shut down before the PC is put to sleep and then restarted after the wake up, the problem does not occur, so the issue indeed seems to have something to do with the cuda context being active when the system is suspended. My work-around for now is to restart Jupyter kernel (I use TF mostly from Jupyter notebooks) before suspending the PC. I will try to file a bug against cuda.</p>", "body_text": "Thanks for the response, @zheng-xq.
