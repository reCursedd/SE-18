So my opinion might change.\nBut my past does include two decades of experience developing computer system\nsoftware.  My view is that the big problem with tensorflow is mainly that it is\nintrinsically hard.  No group is able to architect a complex UI in advance of\nany experience with developing and using it.  On a realistic scale, I would give\ntensorflow an high grade.

I think the base design did make a big\nmistake with a configuration architecture that left major objects like the\nsession context and the default graph as implicit global variables.  I also am skeptical of\nthe value of eager mode.  Had the base design been better, perhaps only\none architecture would have emerged for models, graphs, and layers.
