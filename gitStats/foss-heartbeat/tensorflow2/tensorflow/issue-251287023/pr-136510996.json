If it is not ready, it will be reached again in the future and will be ready at some point.\nIn our case, doing a BFS from Var to Tanh give us 2 expected gradients, one from Assign and one from MatMul, whereas doing a BFS from Tanh to Var, we will reach Var only once, because we can't reach Assign from Tanh. In that case, the pending count will never reach Zero, Var will never be ready and the BFS will end. At the end, a check is done and if pending nodes are still there, an error is raised.\nThis PR updates the gradient method to ignore nodes that have 0 outgoing edges and are not in the list of Output (Tanh is the only one in the list of outputs in our case).\nThe unit tests have been updated to use Variable with Assign nodes and not Const, because differentiating w.r.t Const make less sense and the error would have been catched before.", "merged": true, "mergeable": null, "rebaseable": null, "mergeable_state": "unknown", "merged_by": {"login": "martinwicke", "id": 577277, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjU3NzI3Nw==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/577277?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/martinwicke", "html_url": "https://github.com/martinwicke", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/martinwicke/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/martinwicke/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/martinwicke/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/martinwicke/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/martinwicke/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/martinwicke/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/martinwicke/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/martinwicke/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/martinwicke/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "comments": 20, "review_comments": 22, "maintainer_can_modify": false, "commits": 9, "additions": 127, "deletions": 2, "changed_files": 4}
