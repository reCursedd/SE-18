I checked the global step and indeed it behaves like you explained for tf.train.Supervisor, except for a short initial phase. In my case the model error with asynchronous training got bad after 15 to 20 Workers. When using synchronous training I can scale beyond 40 workers after increasing my learning rate by sqrt(workers), because of increased batch size. So the synchronization seems to work as expected. Issue can be closed.</p>", "body_text": "@utkrist Thank you for your informative answer.
