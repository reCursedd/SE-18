For each possible data type\n+ * that can be used in a tensor, there is a corresponding class in this package that\n+ * is used to represent it. For example, the TensorFlow int32 type is represented by\n+ * the type TFInt32 and by the class object TFInt32.class. The former is used to\n+ * support compile-time checking of tensor data types and the latter is used for\n+ * run-time checking of data types. All such classes implement the TFType interface.\n+ *`\n+ * <p><b>WARNING</b>: The API is currently experimental and is not covered by TensorFlow <a", "path": "tensorflow/java/src/main/java/org/tensorflow/types/package-info.java", "position": null, "original_position": 24, "commit_id": "1020ee116d2bf99bc90e95730a8431fb001fbb40", "original_commit_id": "310bbf1de4487d425f3e84e957dcb4d145c1ff46", "user": {"login": "asimshankar", "id": 16018, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE2MDE4", "avatar_url": "https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/16018?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/asimshankar", "html_url": "https://github.com/asimshankar", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/asimshankar/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/asimshankar/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/asimshankar/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/asimshankar/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/asimshankar/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/asimshankar/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/asimshankar/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/asimshankar/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/asimshankar/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "body": "You can remove this, but perhaps talk about the distinction between the classes here and the `{@link org.tensorflow.DataType} enum`?", "created_at": "2017-07-12T06:28:45Z", "updated_at": "2017-07-12T23:42:42Z", "html_url": "https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/pull/11251#discussion_r126872895", "pull_request_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/tensorflow/tensorflow/pulls/11251", "author_association": "MEMBER", "_links": {"self": {"href": "https://api.github.com/repos/tensorflow/tensorflow/pulls/comments/126872895"}, "html": {"href": "https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/pull/11251#discussion_r126872895"}, "pull_request": {"href": "https://api.github.com/repos/tensorflow/tensorflow/pulls/11251"}}, "body_html": "<p>You can remove this, but perhaps talk about the distinction between the classes here and the <code>{@link org.tensorflow.DataType} enum</code>?</p>", "body_text": "You can remove this, but perhaps talk about the distinction between the classes here and the {@link org.tensorflow.DataType} enum?"}
