Probably someone from Tensorflow should explain to be certain, but there was a major upgrade to the local training version of train_and_evaluate. My understanding is it now runs evaluation via a <code>tf.train.CheckpointSaverListener</code>. As such, the evaluation frequency is determined by the saving frequency.
