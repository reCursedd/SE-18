If upgrading is not possible, then you may still run\n TensorFlow with GPU support, if you @{$install_sources$install TensorFlow from Sources}.\n \n \n-## Determine how to install TensorFlow\n-\n-You must pick the mechanism by which you install TensorFlow. The\n-supported choices are as follows:\n-\n-  * [Virtualenv](#InstallingVirtualenv)\n-  * [\"native\" pip](#InstallingNativePip)\n-  * [Docker](#InstallingDocker)\n-  * [Anaconda](#InstallingAnaconda)\n-  * installing from sources, which is documented in\n-    [a separate guide](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/install_sources).\n-\n-**We recommend the Virtualenv installation.**\n-[Virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/stable/)\n-is a virtual Python environment isolated from other Python development,\n-incapable of interfering with or being affected by other Python programs\n-on the same machine.  During the Virtualenv installation process,\n-you will install not only TensorFlow but also all the packages that\n-TensorFlow requires.  (This is actually pretty easy.)\n-To start working with TensorFlow, you simply need to \"activate\" the\n-virtual environment.  All in all, Virtualenv provides a safe and\n-reliable mechanism for installing and running TensorFlow.\n-\n-Native pip installs TensorFlow directly on your system without going\n-through any container system. **We recommend the native pip install for\n-system administrators aiming to make TensorFlow available to everyone on a\n-multi-user system.** Since a native pip installation is not walled-off in\n-a separate container, the pip installation might interfere with other\n-Python-based installations on your system. However, if you understand pip\n-and your Python environment, a native pip installation often entails only\n-a single command.\n+## How to install TensorFlow\n \n-Docker completely isolates the TensorFlow installation\n-from pre-existing packages on your machine. The Docker container contains\n-TensorFlow and all its dependencies. Note that the Docker image can be quite\n-large (hundreds of MBs). You might choose the Docker installation if you are\n-incorporating TensorFlow into a larger application architecture that already\n-uses Docker.\n-\n-In Anaconda, you may use conda to create a virtual environment.\n-However, within Anaconda, we recommend installing TensorFlow with the\n-`pip install` command, not with the `conda install` command.\n-\n-**NOTE:** The conda package is community supported, not officially supported.\n-That is, the TensorFlow team neither tests nor maintains the conda package.\n-Use that package at your own risk.\n+There are a few options to install TensorFlow on your machine:\n \n+* [Use pip in a virtual environment](#InstallingVirtualenv) *(recommended)*\n+* [Use pip in your system environment](#InstallingNativePip)\n+* [Configure a Docker container](#InstallingDocker)\n+* [Use pip in Anaconda](#InstallingAnaconda)\n+* [Install TensorFlow from source](/install/install_sources)\n \n <a name=\"InstallingVirtualenv\"></a>\n-## Installing with Virtualenv\n-\n-Take the following steps to install TensorFlow with Virtualenv:\n-\n-  1. Install pip and Virtualenv by issuing one of the following commands:\n-\n-     <pre>$ <b>sudo apt-get install python-pip python-dev python-virtualenv</b> # for Python 2.7\n-    $ <b>sudo apt-get install python3-pip python3-dev python-virtualenv</b> # for Python 3.n</pre>\n-\n-  2.
