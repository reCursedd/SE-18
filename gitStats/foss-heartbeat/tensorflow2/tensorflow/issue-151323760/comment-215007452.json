I also  find  this topic quite crucial for the \"user experience\" when we have distributed devices. Generally on cluster we could have really unbalanced GPU/CPU scalar resources ratio and there are different considerations to do for data parallel and model parallel approaches. So it is really interesting to have some feedbacks. /cc <a class=\"user-mention\" data-hovercard-type=\"user\" data-hovercard-url=\"/hovercards?user_id=1943264\" data-octo-click=\"hovercard-link-click\" data-octo-dimensions=\"link_type:self\" href=\"https://github.com/mtamburrano\">@mtamburrano</a> <a class=\"user-mention\" data-hovercard-type=\"user\" data-hovercard-url=\"/hovercards?user_id=2477675\" data-octo-click=\"hovercard-link-click\" data-octo-dimensions=\"link_type:self\" href=\"https://github.com/lenlen\">@lenlen</a></p>", "body_text": "Thank you @windreamer.
