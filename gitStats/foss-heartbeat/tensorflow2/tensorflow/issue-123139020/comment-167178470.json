Set to 1 or greater to suppress info logs. I am not 100% sure it works as new checkins on re2 package, but Ideally it needs to be possible for user to override this parameter via command line. As a workaround, if you are stuck, you can pipeline current output to sed to remove unneeded log lines and get exact output you need.thanks.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/google/re2/blob/master/util/logging.h\">https://github.com/google/re2/blob/master/util/logging.h</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/google/re2/blob/master/util/flags.h\">https://github.com/google/re2/blob/master/util/flags.h</a></li>\n</ul>", "body_text": "Hi @davefairtex ,\nFrom the logging referred to in tensorflow*, I observe the parameter re2::FLAGS_minloglevel that needs to be overridden.
