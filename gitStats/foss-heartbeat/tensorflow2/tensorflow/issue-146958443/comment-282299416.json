The reason why I thought that this information could be there, is because when I generate a timeline in the Chrome trace format and load it in the browsers, for some of the tensors I can see a span in it (see a screenshot below). I tried to understand what this span means and made a wrong hypothesis that it may correspond to the period when the tensor was kept in memory. But from what you are saying it does not seem to be the case. That said, I am still curious: what do the spans in the timeline stand for, why do some tensors have a span associated with them, while other just a creation moment?</p>\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/654434/23306144/16cbd0ae-fa70-11e6-9e9c-d602983cde26.png\"><img src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/654434/23306144/16cbd0ae-fa70-11e6-9e9c-d602983cde26.png\" alt=\"screenshot from 2017-02-24 09 02 43\" style=\"max-width:100%;\"></a></p>\n<p>Thank you <a class=\"user-mention\" data-hovercard-type=\"user\" data-hovercard-url=\"/hovercards?user_id=23068\" data-octo-click=\"hovercard-link-click\" data-octo-dimensions=\"link_type:self\" href=\"https://github.com/yaroslavvb\">@yaroslavvb</a> , I will take a look at your tool!</p>", "body_text": "@poxvoculi , thank you for your explanations.
