Yes, it looks so. I tried by downgrading nvidia driver to 361.62 (cuda 8.0.27) and building Tensorflow 0.9, and it worked. Just one workaround is need to get rid of cuda 8 and gcc 5.4 compatibility issue. I'd to hand-edit /usr/local/cuda/include/host_config.h file to remove that #error that pops up if we've gcc greater 5.3. We've filed a NVIDIA bug for the same.</p>", "body_text": "@sherrym , Thanks.
