Please inherit from `tf.keras.Model`.\n+* Adding support of core feature columns and losses to gradient boosted trees estimators.\n+* The Bijector API now requires 'event_ndims' passed in to the `log_det_jacobian` methods, while `event_ndims` is removed from the base class and replaced with `forward_min_event_ndims`. The signature is now `log_det_jacobian(x, event_ndims)`. The main rationale for this change is that it allows Bijectors to broadcast.\n+RELNOTES: If you were using layers from `tf.keras.layers` in conjunction with custom variable scopes, your layer variable names might have changed. If you were using layers from `tf.layers` in a subclassed `tf.keras.Model` class, then your variable names have changed (you can restore the prior names by importing the same layers from `tf.keras.layers` instead of `tf.layers`).", "path": "RELEASE.md", "position": null, "original_position": 8, "commit_id": "81e1e1261b67973575652803a7c8dec0e15def0a", "original_commit_id": "4641e3c36857a23b0ae4e49e4f7988e8f39cca80", "user": {"login": "rajatmonga", "id": 15679194, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE1Njc5MTk0", "avatar_url": "https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/15679194?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/rajatmonga", "html_url": "https://github.com/rajatmonga", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rajatmonga/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rajatmonga/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rajatmonga/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rajatmonga/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rajatmonga/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rajatmonga/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rajatmonga/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rajatmonga/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rajatmonga/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "body": "Simplify to something like:\r\n\r\nLayer variables names have changed in the following conditions:\r\n- Using `tf.keras.layers` with custom variable scopes\r\n- Using `tf.layers` in a subclassed `tf.keras.Model` class\r\n  See here [add link to details] for more details", "created_at": "2018-06-02T20:23:21Z", "updated_at": "2018-06-05T06:06:07Z", "html_url": "https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/pull/19702#discussion_r192569522", "pull_request_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/tensorflow/tensorflow/pulls/19702", "author_association": "NONE", "_links": {"self": {"href": "https://api.github.com/repos/tensorflow/tensorflow/pulls/comments/192569522"}, "html": {"href": "https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/pull/19702#discussion_r192569522"}, "pull_request": {"href": "https://api.github.com/repos/tensorflow/tensorflow/pulls/19702"}}, "body_html": "<p>Simplify to something like:</p>\n<p>Layer variables names have changed in the following conditions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Using <code>tf.keras.layers</code> with custom variable scopes</li>\n<li>Using <code>tf.layers</code> in a subclassed <code>tf.keras.Model</code> class<br>\nSee here [add link to details] for more details</li>\n</ul>", "body_text": "Simplify to something like:\nLayer variables names have changed in the following conditions:\n\nUsing tf.keras.layers with custom variable scopes\nUsing tf.layers in a subclassed tf.keras.Model class\nSee here [add link to details] for more details"}
