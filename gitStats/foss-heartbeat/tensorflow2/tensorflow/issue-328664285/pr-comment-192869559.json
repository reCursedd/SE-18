Please inherit from `tf.keras.Model`.\n+* Adding support of core feature columns and losses to gradient boosted trees estimators.\n+* The Bijector API now requires 'event_ndims' passed in to the `log_det_jacobian` methods, while `event_ndims` is removed from the base class and replaced with `forward_min_event_ndims`. The signature is now `log_det_jacobian(x, event_ndims)`. The main rationale for this change is that it allows Bijectors to broadcast.\n+RELNOTES: If you were using layers from `tf.keras.layers` in conjunction with custom variable scopes, your layer variable names might have changed. If you were using layers from `tf.layers` in a subclassed `tf.keras.Model` class, then your variable names have changed (you can restore the prior names by importing the same layers from `tf.keras.layers` instead of `tf.layers`).", "path": "RELEASE.md", "position": null, "original_position": 8, "commit_id": "81e1e1261b67973575652803a7c8dec0e15def0a", "original_commit_id": "4641e3c36857a23b0ae4e49e4f7988e8f39cca80", "user": {"login": "av8ramit", "id": 5588272, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjU1ODgyNzI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/5588272?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/av8ramit", "html_url": "https://github.com/av8ramit", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/av8ramit/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/av8ramit/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/av8ramit/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/av8ramit/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/av8ramit/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/av8ramit/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/av8ramit/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/av8ramit/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/av8ramit/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "body": "Done.
