Supported languages include Python (via a\n+  pip package) and C++. CUDA 8.0 and cuDNN 5.1 are supported for GPU\n+  acceleration. Known limitations include: It is not currently possible to load\n+  a custom op library. The GCS and HDFS file systems are not currently\n+  supported. The following ops are not currently implemented:\n+  DepthwiseConv2dNative, DepthwiseConv2dNativeBackpropFilter,\n+  DepthwiseConv2dNativeBackpropInput, Dequantize, Digamma, Erf, Erfc, Igamma,\n+  Igammac, Lgamma, Polygamma, QuantizeAndDequantize, QuantizedAvgPool,\n+  QuantizedBatchNomWithGlobalNormalization, QuantizedBiasAdd, QuantizedConcat,\n+  QuantizedConv2D, QuantizedMatmul, QuantizedMaxPool,\n+  QuantizeDownAndShrinkRange, QuantizedRelu, QuantizedRelu6, QuantizedReshape,\n+  QuantizeV2, RequantizationRange, and Requantize.\n+* Go: Experimental API in Go to create and execute graphs\n+  (https://godoc.org/github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tensorflow/go)\n+* New checkpoint format becomes the default in `tf.train.Saver`. Old V1\n+  checkpoints continue to be readable; controlled by the `write_version`\n+  argument, `tf.train.Saver` now by default writes out in the new V2\n+  format. It significantly reduces the peak memory required and latency\n+  incurred during restore.\n+* Added a new library for library of matrix-free (iterative) solvers for linear\n+  equations, linear least-squares, eigenvalues and singular values in\n+  tensorflow/contrib/solvers. Initial version has lanczos bidiagonalization,\n+  conjugate gradients and CGLS.\n+* Added gradients for `matrix_solve_ls` and `self_adjoint_eig`.\n+* Large cleanup to add second order gradient for ops with C++ gradients and\n+  improve existing gradients such that most ops can now be differentiated\n+  multiple times.\n \n ## Breaking Changes to the API\n \n * `BusAdjacency` enum replaced with a protocol buffer `DeviceLocality`.  PCI bus\n-indexing now starts from 1 instead of 0, and bus_id==0 is used where previously\n-BUS_ANY was used.\n-* `Env::FileExists` and `FileSystem::FileExists` now return a tensorflow::Status\n+  indexing now starts from 1 instead of 0, and `bus_id==0` is used where previously\n+  `BUS_ANY` was used.\n+* `Env::FileExists` and `FileSystem::FileExists` now return a `tensorflow::Status`\n   intead of a bool. Any callers to this function can be converted to a bool\n-  by adding .ok() to the call.\n+  by adding `.ok()` to the call.\n * The C API type `TF_SessionWithGraph` has been renamed to `TF_Session`,", "path": "RELEASE.md", "position": null, "original_position": 47, "commit_id": "b002a886f22e0480f69bc31f52ccd0df6379eb01", "original_commit_id": "cc8acb75405bb42d7da69dfe2f8586f60e1f17d7", "user": {"login": "asimshankar", "id": 16018, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE2MDE4", "avatar_url": "https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/16018?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/asimshankar", "html_url": "https://github.com/asimshankar", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/asimshankar/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/asimshankar/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/asimshankar/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/asimshankar/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/asimshankar/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/asimshankar/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/asimshankar/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/asimshankar/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/asimshankar/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "body": "Perhaps prefix the 3 C API changes with: \r\nC API: ...\r\n\r\n instead of \"in the C API\" suffixes in two places and \"The C API type\" prefix in one?", "created_at": "2016-11-23T08:24:10Z", "updated_at": "2016-11-25T08:20:05Z", "html_url": "https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/pull/5797#discussion_r89270737", "pull_request_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/tensorflow/tensorflow/pulls/5797", "author_association": "MEMBER", "_links": {"self": {"href": "https://api.github.com/repos/tensorflow/tensorflow/pulls/comments/89270737"}, "html": {"href": "https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/pull/5797#discussion_r89270737"}, "pull_request": {"href": "https://api.github.com/repos/tensorflow/tensorflow/pulls/5797"}}, "body_html": "<p>Perhaps prefix the 3 C API changes with:<br>\nC API: ...</p>\n<p>instead of \"in the C API\" suffixes in two places and \"The C API type\" prefix in one?</p>", "body_text": "Perhaps prefix the 3 C API changes with:\nC API: ...\ninstead of \"in the C API\" suffixes in two places and \"The C API type\" prefix in one?"}
