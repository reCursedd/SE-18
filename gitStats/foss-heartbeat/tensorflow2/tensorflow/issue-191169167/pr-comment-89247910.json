Supported languages include Python (via a\n+  PIP package) and C++. CUDA 8.0 and cuDNN 5.1 are supported for GPU\n+  acceleration. Known limitations include: It is not currently possible to load\n+  a custom op library. The GCS and HDFS file systems are not currently\n+  supported. The following ops are not currently implemented:\n+  DepthwiseConv2dNative, DepthwiseConv2dNativeBackpropFilter,\n+  DepthwiseConv2dNativeBackpropInput, Dequantize, Digamma, Erf, Erfc, Igamma,\n+  Igammac, Lgamma, Polygamma, QuantizeAndDequantize, QuantizedAvgPool,\n+  QuantizedBatchNomWithGlobalNormalization, QuantizedBiasAdd, QuantizedConcat,\n+  QuantizedConv2D, QuantizedMatmul, QuantizedMaxPool,\n+  QuantizeDownAndShrinkRange, QuantizedRelu, QuantizedRelu6, QuantizedReshape,\n+  QuantizeV2, RequantizationRange, and Requantize.\n+* Go: Experimental API in Go to create and execute graphs\n+  (https://godoc.org/github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tensorflow/go)\n+* New checkpoint format becomes the default in tf.train.Saver.  Old V1\n+  checkpoints continue to be readable; controlled by the \"write\\_version\"\n+  argument, tf.train.Saver now by default writes out in the new V2\n+  format.  It significantly reduced the peak memory required and latency\n+  incurred during restore.\n+* Added a new library for library of matrix-free (iterative) solvers for linear\n+  equations, linear least-squares, eigenvalues and singular values in\n+  tensorflow/contrib/solvers. Initial version has lanczos bidiagonalization,\n+  conjugate gradients and CGLS. More functionality will be added in the coming", "path": "RELEASE.md", "position": null, "original_position": 29, "commit_id": "b002a886f22e0480f69bc31f52ccd0df6379eb01", "original_commit_id": "a555459d8a7ca25283d9a66eb56e7eceed1235e3", "user": {"login": "martinwicke", "id": 577277, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjU3NzI3Nw==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/577277?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/martinwicke", "html_url": "https://github.com/martinwicke", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/martinwicke/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/martinwicke/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/martinwicke/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/martinwicke/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/martinwicke/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/martinwicke/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/martinwicke/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/martinwicke/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/martinwicke/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "body": "remove statements about the future.", "created_at": "2016-11-23T02:13:10Z", "updated_at": "2016-11-25T08:20:05Z", "html_url": "https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/pull/5797#discussion_r89247910", "pull_request_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/tensorflow/tensorflow/pulls/5797", "author_association": "MEMBER", "_links": {"self": {"href": "https://api.github.com/repos/tensorflow/tensorflow/pulls/comments/89247910"}, "html": {"href": "https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/pull/5797#discussion_r89247910"}, "pull_request": {"href": "https://api.github.com/repos/tensorflow/tensorflow/pulls/5797"}}, "body_html": "<p>remove statements about the future.</p>", "body_text": "remove statements about the future."}
