Supported languages include Python (via a\n+  PIP package) and C++. CUDA 8.0 and cuDNN 5.1 are supported for GPU\n+  acceleration. Known limitations include: It is not currently possible to load\n+  a custom op library. The GCS and HDFS file systems are not currently\n+  supported. The following ops are not currently implemented:\n+  DepthwiseConv2dNative, DepthwiseConv2dNativeBackpropFilter,\n+  DepthwiseConv2dNativeBackpropInput, Dequantize, Digamma, Erf, Erfc, Igamma,\n+  Igammac, Lgamma, Polygamma, QuantizeAndDequantize, QuantizedAvgPool,\n+  QuantizedBatchNomWithGlobalNormalization, QuantizedBiasAdd, QuantizedConcat,\n+  QuantizedConv2D, QuantizedMatmul, QuantizedMaxPool,\n+  QuantizeDownAndShrinkRange, QuantizedRelu, QuantizedRelu6, QuantizedReshape,\n+  QuantizeV2, RequantizationRange, and Requantize.\n+* Go: Experimental API in Go to create and execute graphs\n+  (https://godoc.org/github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tensorflow/go)\n+* New checkpoint format becomes the default in tf.train.Saver.  Old V1\n+  checkpoints continue to be readable; controlled by the \"write\\_version\"\n+  argument, tf.train.Saver now by default writes out in the new V2\n+  format.  It significantly reduced the peak memory required and latency\n+  incurred during restore.\n+* Added a new library for library of matrix-free (iterative) solvers for linear\n+  equations, linear least-squares, eigenvalues and singular values in\n+  tensorflow/contrib/solvers. Initial version has lanczos bidiagonalization,\n+  conjugate gradients and CGLS. More functionality will be added in the coming\n+  quarter. Contributions welcome.\n+* Combined batch\\_\\* and regular version of linear algebra and FFT ops. The\n+  regular op now handles batches as well. All batch\\_\\* Python interfaces were\n+  removed,  except for batch\\_matmul.\n+  Added gradients for matrix\\_solve\\_ls and self\\_adjoint\\_eig.\n+* Large cleanup to add second order gradient for ops with C++ gradients and\n+  improve existing gradients such that most ops can now be differentiated\n+  multiple times.\n ", "path": "RELEASE.md", "position": null, "original_position": 38, "commit_id": "b002a886f22e0480f69bc31f52ccd0df6379eb01", "original_commit_id": "3f6d4640ec5ac3b89256107d249a084398c92ae0", "user": {"login": "shoyer", "id": 1217238, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTcyMzg=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/1217238?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/shoyer", "html_url": "https://github.com/shoyer", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/shoyer/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/shoyer/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/shoyer/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/shoyer/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/shoyer/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/shoyer/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/shoyer/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/shoyer/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/shoyer/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "body": "Short but sweet:\r\n\r\n* Added a solver for ordinary differential equations, tf.contrib.integrate.odeint.\r\n* New contrib module for tensors with named axes, tf.contrib.labeled_tensor.", "created_at": "2016-11-23T22:41:20Z", "updated_at": "2016-11-25T08:20:05Z", "html_url": "https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/pull/5797#discussion_r89410670", "pull_request_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/tensorflow/tensorflow/pulls/5797", "author_association": "MEMBER", "_links": {"self": {"href": "https://api.github.com/repos/tensorflow/tensorflow/pulls/comments/89410670"}, "html": {"href": "https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/pull/5797#discussion_r89410670"}, "pull_request": {"href": "https://api.github.com/repos/tensorflow/tensorflow/pulls/5797"}}, "body_html": "<p>Short but sweet:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Added a solver for ordinary differential equations, tf.contrib.integrate.odeint.</li>\n<li>New contrib module for tensors with named axes, tf.contrib.labeled_tensor.</li>\n</ul>", "body_text": "Short but sweet:\n\nAdded a solver for ordinary differential equations, tf.contrib.integrate.odeint.\nNew contrib module for tensors with named axes, tf.contrib.labeled_tensor.", "in_reply_to_id": 89252241}
