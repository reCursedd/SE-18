Supported languages include Python (via a\n+  PIP package) and C++. CUDA 8.0 and cuDNN 5.1 are supported for GPU\n+  acceleration. Known limitations include: It is not currently possible to load\n+  a custom op library. The GCS and HDFS file systems are not currently\n+  supported. The following ops are not currently implemented:\n+  DepthwiseConv2dNative, DepthwiseConv2dNativeBackpropFilter,\n+  DepthwiseConv2dNativeBackpropInput, Dequantize, Digamma, Erf, Erfc, Igamma,\n+  Igammac, Lgamma, Polygamma, QuantizeAndDequantize, QuantizedAvgPool,\n+  QuantizedBatchNomWithGlobalNormalization, QuantizedBiasAdd, QuantizedConcat,\n+  QuantizedConv2D, QuantizedMatmul, QuantizedMaxPool,\n+  QuantizeDownAndShrinkRange, QuantizedRelu, QuantizedRelu6, QuantizedReshape,\n+  QuantizeV2, RequantizationRange, and Requantize.\n+* Go: Experimental API in Go to create and execute graphs\n+  (https://godoc.org/github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tensorflow/go)\n+* New checkpoint format becomes the default in tf.train.Saver.  Old V1\n+  checkpoints continue to be readable; controlled by the \"write\\_version\"\n+  argument, tf.train.Saver now by default writes out in the new V2\n+  format.  It significantly reduced the peak memory required and latency\n+  incurred during restore.\n+* Added a new library for library of matrix-free (iterative) solvers for linear\n+  equations, linear least-squares, eigenvalues and singular values in\n+  tensorflow/contrib/solvers. Initial version has lanczos bidiagonalization,\n+  conjugate gradients and CGLS. More functionality will be added in the coming\n+  quarter. Contributions welcome.\n+* Combined batch\\_\\* and regular version of linear algebra and FFT ops. The\n+  regular op now handles batches as well. All batch\\_\\* Python interfaces were\n+  removed,  except for batch\\_matmul.\n+  Added gradients for matrix\\_solve\\_ls and self\\_adjoint\\_eig.\n+* Large cleanup to add second order gradient for ops with C++ gradients and\n+  improve existing gradients such that most ops can now be differentiated\n+  multiple times.\n \n ## Breaking Changes to the API\n \n * `BusAdjacency` enum replaced with a protocol buffer `DeviceLocality`.  PCI bus\n-indexing now starts from 1 instead of 0, and bus_id==0 is used where previously\n-BUS_ANY was used.\n+  indexing now starts from 1 instead of 0, and bus\\_id==0 is used where previously\n+  BUS\\_ANY was used.\n * `Env::FileExists` and `FileSystem::FileExists` now return a tensorflow::Status\n   intead of a bool. Any callers to this function can be converted to a bool\n   by adding .ok() to the call.\n-* The C API type `TF_SessionWithGraph` has been renamed to `TF_Session`,\n+* The C API type `TF\\_SessionWithGraph` has been renamed to `TF\\_Session`,\n   indicating its preferred use in language bindings for TensorFlow.\n-  What was previously `TF_Session` has been renamed to `TF_DeprecatedSession`.\n-* Renamed TF_Port to TF_Output in the C API.\n+  What was previously `TF\\_Session` has been renamed to `TF\\_DeprecatedSession`.\n+* Renamed TF\\_Port to TF\\_Output in the C API.\n+* In the C API the caller retains ownership of TF\\_Tensor objects provided to TF\\_Run,\n+  TF\\_SessionRun, TF\\_SetAttrTensor etc.\n+* Renamed tf.image.per\\_image\\_whitening() to tf.image.per\\_image\\_standardization()\n+* Move Summary protobuf constructors to tf.summary submodule.\n+* Deprecate histogram\\_summary, audio\\_summary, scalar\\_summary, image\\_summary,\n+  merge\\_summary, and merge\\_all\\_summaries.\n+\n+## Bug Fixes and Other Changes\n+\n+* Use threadsafe version of lgamma function.\n+* Fix tf.sqrt handling of negative arguments.\n+* Fixed bug causing incorrect number of threads to be used for multi-threaded\n+  benchmarks.\n+* Performance optimizations for batch\\_matmul on multi-core CPUs.\n+* Improve trace, matrix\\_set\\_diag, matrix\\_diag\\_part and their gradients to work\n+  for rectangular matrices.\n+* Support for SVD of complex valued matrices.\n+* Changed FileExists in Env and FileSystem to return tensorflow::Status instead\n+  of bool.\n+\n+\n+## Thanks to our Contributors\n+\n+This release contains contributions from many people at Google, as well as:\n+\n+@a7744hsc, Abhi Agg, @admcrae, Adriano Carmezim, Aki Sukegawa, Alex Kendall,\n+Alexander Rosenberg Johansen, @amcrae, Amlan Kar, Andre Simpelo, Andreas Eberle,\n+Andrew Hundt, Arnaud Lenglet, @b0noI, Balachander Ramachandran, Ben Barsdell,\n+Ben Guidarelli, Benjamin Mularczyk, Burness Duan, @c0g, Changming Sun,\n+@chanis, Corey Wharton, Dan J, Daniel Trebbien, Darren Garvey, David Brailovsky,\n+David Jones, Di Zeng, @DjangoPeng, Dr. Kashif Rasul, @drag0, Fabrizio (Misto) Milo,\n+Fabr\u00edCio Ceschin, @fp, @Ghedeon, @guschmue, G\u00f6k\u00e7en Eraslan, Haosdent Huang,\n+Haroen Viaene, Harold Cooper, Henrik Holst, @hoangmit, Ivan Ukhov, Javier Dehesa,\n+Jingtian Peng, Jithin Odattu, Joan Pastor, Johan Mathe, Johannes Mayer,\n+Jongwook Choi, Justus Schwabedal, Kai Wolf, Kamil Hryniewicz, Kamran Amini,\n+Karen Brems, Karl Lattimer, @kborer, Ken Shirriff, Kevin Rose, Larissa Laich,\n+Laurent Mazare, Leonard Lee, Liang-Chi Hsieh, Liangliang He, Luke Iwanski,\n+Marek Kolodziej, Moustafa Alzantot, @MrQianjinsi, @nagachika, Neil Han, Nick Meehan,\n+Niels Ole Salscheider, Nikhil Mishra, @nschuc, Ondrej Skopek, Ond\u0159Ej Filip,\n+@OscarDPan, Pablo Moyano, Przemyslaw Tredak, @qitaishui, @Quarazy, @raix852,", "path": "RELEASE.md", "position": null, "original_position": 95, "commit_id": "b002a886f22e0480f69bc31f52ccd0df6379eb01", "original_commit_id": "3f6d4640ec5ac3b89256107d249a084398c92ae0", "user": {"login": "terrytangyuan", "id": 4269898, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjQyNjk4OTg=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/4269898?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/terrytangyuan", "html_url": "https://github.com/terrytangyuan", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/terrytangyuan/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/terrytangyuan/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/terrytangyuan/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/terrytangyuan/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/terrytangyuan/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/terrytangyuan/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/terrytangyuan/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/terrytangyuan/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/terrytangyuan/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "body": "Could you add my name too?
