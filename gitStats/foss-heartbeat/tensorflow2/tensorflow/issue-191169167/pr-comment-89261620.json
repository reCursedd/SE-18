Supported languages include Python (via a\n+  PIP package) and C++. CUDA 8.0 and cuDNN 5.1 are supported for GPU\n+  acceleration. Known limitations include: It is not currently possible to load\n+  a custom op library. The GCS and HDFS file systems are not currently\n+  supported. The following ops are not currently implemented:\n+  DepthwiseConv2dNative, DepthwiseConv2dNativeBackpropFilter,\n+  DepthwiseConv2dNativeBackpropInput, Dequantize, Digamma, Erf, Erfc, Igamma,\n+  Igammac, Lgamma, Polygamma, QuantizeAndDequantize, QuantizedAvgPool,\n+  QuantizedBatchNomWithGlobalNormalization, QuantizedBiasAdd, QuantizedConcat,\n+  QuantizedConv2D, QuantizedMatmul, QuantizedMaxPool,\n+  QuantizeDownAndShrinkRange, QuantizedRelu, QuantizedRelu6, QuantizedReshape,\n+  QuantizeV2, RequantizationRange, and Requantize.\n+* Go: Experimental API in Go to create and execute graphs\n+  (https://godoc.org/github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tensorflow/go)\n+* New checkpoint format becomes the default in tf.train.Saver.  Old V1\n+  checkpoints continue to be readable; controlled by the \"write\\_version\"\n+  argument, tf.train.Saver now by default writes out in the new V2\n+  format.  It significantly reduced the peak memory required and latency\n+  incurred during restore.\n+* Added a new library for library of matrix-free (iterative) solvers for linear\n+  equations, linear least-squares, eigenvalues and singular values in\n+  tensorflow/contrib/solvers. Initial version has lanczos bidiagonalization,\n+  conjugate gradients and CGLS. More functionality will be added in the coming\n+  quarter. Contributions welcome.\n+* Combined batch\\_\\* and regular version of linear algebra and FFT ops. The\n+  regular op now handles batches as well. All batch\\_\\* Python interfaces were\n+  removed,  except for batch\\_matmul.\n+  Added gradients for matrix\\_solve\\_ls and self\\_adjoint\\_eig.\n+* Large cleanup to add second order gradient for ops with C++ gradients and\n+  improve existing gradients such that most ops can now be differentiated\n+  multiple times.\n \n ## Breaking Changes to the API", "path": "RELEASE.md", "position": null, "original_position": 39, "commit_id": "b002a886f22e0480f69bc31f52ccd0df6379eb01", "original_commit_id": "a555459d8a7ca25283d9a66eb56e7eceed1235e3", "user": {"login": "gunan", "id": 7946809, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjc5NDY4MDk=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/7946809?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/gunan", "html_url": "https://github.com/gunan", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/gunan/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/gunan/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/gunan/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/gunan/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/gunan/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/gunan/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/gunan/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/gunan/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/gunan/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "body": "@ilblackdragon Could you send me what you would like to have included here?", "created_at": "2016-11-23T06:29:35Z", "updated_at": "2016-11-25T08:20:05Z", "html_url": "https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/pull/5797#discussion_r89261620", "pull_request_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/tensorflow/tensorflow/pulls/5797", "author_association": "MEMBER", "_links": {"self": {"href": "https://api.github.com/repos/tensorflow/tensorflow/pulls/comments/89261620"}, "html": {"href": "https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/pull/5797#discussion_r89261620"}, "pull_request": {"href": "https://api.github.com/repos/tensorflow/tensorflow/pulls/5797"}}, "body_html": "<p><a class=\"user-mention\" data-hovercard-type=\"user\" data-hovercard-url=\"/hovercards?user_id=175486\" data-octo-click=\"hovercard-link-click\" data-octo-dimensions=\"link_type:self\" href=\"https://github.com/ilblackdragon\">@ilblackdragon</a> Could you send me what you would like to have included here?</p>", "body_text": "@ilblackdragon Could you send me what you would like to have included here?", "in_reply_to_id": 89248024}
