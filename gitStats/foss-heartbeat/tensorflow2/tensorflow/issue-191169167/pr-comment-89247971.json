Supported languages include Python (via a\n+  PIP package) and C++. CUDA 8.0 and cuDNN 5.1 are supported for GPU\n+  acceleration. Known limitations include: It is not currently possible to load\n+  a custom op library. The GCS and HDFS file systems are not currently\n+  supported. The following ops are not currently implemented:\n+  DepthwiseConv2dNative, DepthwiseConv2dNativeBackpropFilter,\n+  DepthwiseConv2dNativeBackpropInput, Dequantize, Digamma, Erf, Erfc, Igamma,\n+  Igammac, Lgamma, Polygamma, QuantizeAndDequantize, QuantizedAvgPool,\n+  QuantizedBatchNomWithGlobalNormalization, QuantizedBiasAdd, QuantizedConcat,\n+  QuantizedConv2D, QuantizedMatmul, QuantizedMaxPool,\n+  QuantizeDownAndShrinkRange, QuantizedRelu, QuantizedRelu6, QuantizedReshape,\n+  QuantizeV2, RequantizationRange, and Requantize.\n+* Go: Experimental API in Go to create and execute graphs\n+  (https://godoc.org/github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tensorflow/go)\n+* New checkpoint format becomes the default in tf.train.Saver.  Old V1\n+  checkpoints continue to be readable; controlled by the \"write\\_version\"\n+  argument, tf.train.Saver now by default writes out in the new V2\n+  format.  It significantly reduced the peak memory required and latency\n+  incurred during restore.\n+* Added a new library for library of matrix-free (iterative) solvers for linear\n+  equations, linear least-squares, eigenvalues and singular values in\n+  tensorflow/contrib/solvers. Initial version has lanczos bidiagonalization,\n+  conjugate gradients and CGLS. More functionality will be added in the coming\n+  quarter. Contributions welcome.\n+* Combined batch\\_\\* and regular version of linear algebra and FFT ops. The\n+  regular op now handles batches as well. All batch\\_\\* Python interfaces were\n+  removed,  except for batch\\_matmul.\n+  Added gradients for matrix\\_solve\\_ls and self\\_adjoint\\_eig.\n+* Large cleanup to add second order gradient for ops with C++ gradients and\n+  improve existing gradients such that most ops can now be differentiated\n+  multiple times.\n \n ## Breaking Changes to the API\n \n * `BusAdjacency` enum replaced with a protocol buffer `DeviceLocality`.  PCI bus\n-indexing now starts from 1 instead of 0, and bus_id==0 is used where previously\n-BUS_ANY was used.\n+  indexing now starts from 1 instead of 0, and bus\\_id==0 is used where previously\n+  BUS\\_ANY was used.\n * `Env::FileExists` and `FileSystem::FileExists` now return a tensorflow::Status\n   intead of a bool. Any callers to this function can be converted to a bool\n   by adding .ok() to the call.\n-* The C API type `TF_SessionWithGraph` has been renamed to `TF_Session`,\n+* The C API type `TF\\_SessionWithGraph` has been renamed to `TF\\_Session`,\n   indicating its preferred use in language bindings for TensorFlow.\n-  What was previously `TF_Session` has been renamed to `TF_DeprecatedSession`.\n-* Renamed TF_Port to TF_Output in the C API.\n+  What was previously `TF\\_Session` has been renamed to `TF\\_DeprecatedSession`.\n+* Renamed TF\\_Port to TF\\_Output in the C API.\n+* In the C API the caller retains ownership of TF\\_Tensor objects provided to TF\\_Run,\n+  TF\\_SessionRun, TF\\_SetAttrTensor etc.\n+* Renamed tf.image.per\\_image\\_whitening() to tf.image.per\\_image\\_standardization()\n+* Move Summary protobuf constructors to tf.summary submodule.\n+* Deprecate histogram\\_summary, audio\\_summary, scalar\\_summary, image\\_summary,\n+  merge\\_summary, and merge\\_all\\_summaries.\n+\n+## Bug Fixes and Other Changes\n+\n+* Use threadsafe version of lgamma function.\n+* Fix tf.sqrt handling of negative arguments.\n+* Fixed bug causing incorrect number of threads to be used for multi-threaded\n+  benchmarks.\n+* Performance optimizations for batch\\_matmul on multi-core CPUs.\n+* Improve trace, matrix\\_set\\_diag, matrix\\_diag\\_part and their gradients to work\n+  for rectangular matrices.\n+* Support for SVD of complex valued matrices.\n+* Changed FileExists in Env and FileSystem to return tensorflow::Status instead", "path": "RELEASE.md", "position": null, "original_position": 73, "commit_id": "b002a886f22e0480f69bc31f52ccd0df6379eb01", "original_commit_id": "a555459d8a7ca25283d9a66eb56e7eceed1235e3", "user": {"login": "martinwicke", "id": 577277, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjU3NzI3Nw==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/577277?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/martinwicke", "html_url": "https://github.com/martinwicke", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/martinwicke/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/martinwicke/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/martinwicke/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/martinwicke/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/martinwicke/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/martinwicke/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/martinwicke/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/martinwicke/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/martinwicke/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "body": "duplicate: covered in breaking changes.", "created_at": "2016-11-23T02:13:57Z", "updated_at": "2016-11-25T08:20:05Z", "html_url": "https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/pull/5797#discussion_r89247971", "pull_request_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/tensorflow/tensorflow/pulls/5797", "author_association": "MEMBER", "_links": {"self": {"href": "https://api.github.com/repos/tensorflow/tensorflow/pulls/comments/89247971"}, "html": {"href": "https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/pull/5797#discussion_r89247971"}, "pull_request": {"href": "https://api.github.com/repos/tensorflow/tensorflow/pulls/5797"}}, "body_html": "<p>duplicate: covered in breaking changes.</p>", "body_text": "duplicate: covered in breaking changes."}
