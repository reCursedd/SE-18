Although it would be convenient in the scenario you're describing, such a mechanism would also make it harder to reason about what a particular snippet of code is expected to do.  In general we'd like to keep the configuration codepath reasonably straightforward, so I don't think we'll be adding such a mechanism.</p>\n<p>Hope that makes sense.
