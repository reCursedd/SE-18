I am having a hard time following all of the code references, e.g. wrappers around everything.  I am not doubting it is correct but about about 30 minutes of scanning through the code I know it is beyond me to follow. This is a shot in the dark but if you are trying things to see if they impact the time, I would remove feed_dic completely.  You can decrease/decay the learning rate (even on a set schedule) via the optimizer combined with global_step, which is the way I normally see it done.  I am not saying that will fix your issue, that is just the only thing I see that sticks out to me.  Sorry.  Maybe someone else will take a look.  I know we are working on a wide&amp;deep model to open source but it may not be your exact one.  I will try to check on that, it might also give me an idea of what might be causing you problems.
