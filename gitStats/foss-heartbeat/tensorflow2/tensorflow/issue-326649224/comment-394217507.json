As for Resnet50 model containing CNN layers, I just wonder whether Tensorflow engine supports CNN <code>bias weight</code> when training Resnet50 model? Why I see no <code>cudnnConvolutionBackwardBias</code> is invoked? It seems to be only way to get the <code>bias weight</code> of a CNN layer, if it is not even invoked, I think Tensorflow doesn't manage any CNN <code>bias weight</code>, does anyone know whether I am right?</p>", "body_text": "@ppwwyyxx Hi, I have an extra question about this tf_cnn_benchmark script.
