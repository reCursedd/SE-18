I installed from scratch cuda 9.2 with cudnn 7.14 and ncc2.2.13 per nvidia website then installed TF from the source via bazel all were successful as I ran a toy code Hello and worked but when I checked devices it was only CPU and not GPU which was a disappointment.  Then per nvidia suggestion I downloaded the coda 9.2 samples and compiled and ran. /deviceQuery and I got the table which declares that cuda 9.2 and cunn 7.14 are configured correctly as it shows the GPU device and its compatibility with the runtime of Ubuntu software and finally s pass on the test!  So I don't know why on earth I cannot get TF 1.8 run on GPU.  This leaves me with suspiciousion that there is an incompatibility here between TF 1.8 gpu and cuda 9.2 that tensorflow website is not telling us.   I hope I am wrong and there is something I am missing to get gpu working. Let me know if anyone has ideas or suggestions.
