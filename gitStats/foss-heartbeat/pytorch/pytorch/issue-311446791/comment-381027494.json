It's nice to hear that Caffe2 is going to support GPU Predictor<br>\nand thread-safe prediction very soon.

It's perfectly OK if this pull request won't finally get merged, I just want to share my work with the open-source community in case anyone needs it, but I also respect and will migrate to the official implementation after that ships.</p>", "body_text": "@salexspb Thanks for your clarification.
