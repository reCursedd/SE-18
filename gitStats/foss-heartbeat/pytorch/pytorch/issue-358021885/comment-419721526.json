I agree, it increase the API complexity by using a string format and with only one option available. It is indeed rare for users who want to use highest protocol, however, in some cases, the highest protocol supports better for large object and bytes object which is poorly supported by protocol 2. So I changed the API a bit, as an optional bool flag. By default, the <code>save()</code> function is not affected for common use cases.</p>", "body_text": "@ezyang Thanks for the comment.
