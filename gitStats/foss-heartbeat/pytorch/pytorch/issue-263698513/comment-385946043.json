If you want to test reducing the power draw you can use \"nvidia-smi -pl X\" where X is the new power draw. For my gtx 1080i I used \"nvidia-smi -pl 150\" whereas standard draw is 250W. I am waiting on more potent PSU to test if it solves the problem. Currently I have a measuring device to measure the power coming directly from the wall, but even when I am using 4 GPUs it does not pass the 1000W. It can still be some weird peaks that are not being registered but something is off. Either way, we probably need to go with the dual 1500W PSUs.</p>", "body_text": "@gurkirt For now, I am only using 2 GPUs with my 1500W PSU.
