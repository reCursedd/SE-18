As I said if you install with cuda9 through anaconda and then tying to import torch throws the above error. If you try to upgrade conda packages then it downgrades to cuda8. The question is how to use cuda9 + pytorch without errors?</p>", "body_text": "@bamtercelboo thanks for the reference bu that's cuda8 and I was trying to use cuda9.
