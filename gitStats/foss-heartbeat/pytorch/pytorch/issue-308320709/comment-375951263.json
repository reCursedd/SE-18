It would be even more useful to provide it as an optional arg to <code>__init__</code>, just as <code>scale_tril</code> can currently be a substitute for <code>covariance_matrix</code>. This would be especially nice because the <code>precision_matrix</code> often has block structure or another sparsity pattern, and is useful as a parameterization.
