The CUDAEvent proposed in #9726 was similar to the c10d::CUDAEvent class with additional testing and functionality. In particular, it was movable but not copyable. The CUDAEvent created by #10581 is refcounted and copyable. This PR retains the refcounting of the latter PR while fixing several bugs, adding tests, and extending the functionality to support testing and usage like in PR #8354. In particular, this PR:\r\n\r\n- Adds set_device() to CUDAContext\r\n- Adds three CUDAEvent tests to stream_test.cpp \r\n- Fixes three bugs:\r\n- Refcounting was broken. Destroying an of the RAIIs holding a particular CUDAEvent would destroy the event UNLESS it was the last RAII (the check was backwards).\r\n- Moving an event would cause a segfault.\r\n- Events were not destroyed on the device they were created on. See PR #9415 (@pietern)\r\n- Adds the happened() and recordOnce() functions\r\n- Changes the record() functions to not be const\r\n- Adds additional assertions to verify correctness\r\n\r\nThis PR does not:\r\n\r\n- Make c10d use the ATen CUDAEvent (this is appropriate for a separate PR)\r\n\r\nWhether events should be refcounted is an interesting question. It adds some atomic operations and makes event creation eager. Making events movable but not copyable (like the c10d events) avoids these costs and allows events to be lazily constructed. Lazy construction is preferable when working with containers (like std::array or std::vector) and because the event's device can be set automatically to the first stream it's recorded on. With eager construction the user is required to understand that events have a device and acquire the device of the stream the event will be recorded on upfront. This can be seen here:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/542aadd9a7609892e207c1e15de08a975b697752/aten/src/ATen/native/cudnn/RNN.cpp#L1130-L1132\r\n\r\nand that file is the only one which currently uses the ATen CUDAEvent.\r\n\r\nRefcounting does allow single writer multi-reader scenarios, although these scenarios can be also be supported by providing indirect access to the underlying CUDAEvent. I believe all current and planned usage scenarios do not require refcounting, and if desired I can update this PR to remove refcounting and make the ATen event movable but not copyable like the c10d event. I think not refcounting is preferable because it can improve performance, ease usability, and simplify the code (as seen with two of the above bugs). \r\n\r\nI have decided to separate this from PR #8354 since while it's required for PR #8354 the changes are, clearly, of independent interest. PR #8354 has a new dependency on this one, however. I am closing PR #9726 in favor of this PR. \r\n\r\n@apaszke @ezyang @pietern ", "created_at": "2018-09-05T20:24:35Z", "updated_at": "2018-11-23T15:50:37Z", "closed_at": "2018-09-07T04:40:53Z",

It adds some atomic operations and makes event creation eager. Making events movable but not copyable (like the c10d events) avoids these costs and allows events to be lazily constructed. Lazy construction is preferable when working with containers (like std::array or std::vector) and because the event's device can be set automatically to the first stream it's recorded on. With eager construction the user is required to understand that events have a device and acquire the device of the stream the event will be recorded on upfront.
