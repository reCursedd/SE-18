What I don't get is why the error is showing up on a build that does not involve <code>libtorch</code>, as <code>libtorch</code> is only built on  <code>pr/pytorch-linux-xenial-cuda9-cudnn7-py3</code> and <code>pr/pytorch-linux-trusty-py3.6-gcc7.2</code>. Could it be leftover <code>CMakeCache.txt</code> or the like?</p>", "body_text": "Thank you @ezyang!
