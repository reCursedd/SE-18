I quite like the proposal, and would like to see something like this in the core. There are certainly parts that will need to be changed, because e.g. Variable wrapping will soon be unnecessary anyway. This also needs some discussion, because if we're going to add device-bound dtypes, then it might be unnecessary. I'll try to review this and get back to you with more concrete comments sometime soon.</p>", "body_text": "@Erotemic Sorry for the delay.
