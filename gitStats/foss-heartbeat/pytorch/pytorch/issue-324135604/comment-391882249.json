I've been trying for several days to compile from source so I could test it, but I seem to be down a rabbit hole where everything I do breaks something else.  I first uninstalled the conda build of PyTorch, and after some effort (see <a class=\"issue-link js-issue-link\" data-error-text=\"Failed to load issue title\" data-id=\"325427419\" data-permission-text=\"Issue title is private\" data-url=\"https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/issues/7764\" data-hovercard-type=\"issue\" data-hovercard-url=\"/pytorch/pytorch/issues/7764/hovercard\" href=\"https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/issues/7764\">#7764</a>) managed to do that.  Then I uninstalled the conda build of Caffe2 (probably a mistake) and tried to compile a consistent build of that from the same repository revision.  That took quite a bit more effort (see <a class=\"issue-link js-issue-link\" data-error-text=\"Failed to load issue title\" data-id=\"325446857\" data-permission-text=\"Issue title is private\" data-url=\"https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/issues/7770\" data-hovercard-type=\"issue\" data-hovercard-url=\"/pytorch/pytorch/issues/7770/hovercard\" href=\"https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/issues/7770\">#7770</a>), but eventually I succeeded.  Only then I couldn't get <code>convert-onnx-to-caffe2</code> to work anymore.  Eventually I decided that compiling Caffe2 had been a mistake, so I did my best to uninstall it (difficult, because it spews files all over the filesystem) and reinstalled the conda build.  I was then able to convert my files.  But somewhere in all of that, something else in my system has gotten broken.  My C++ program that uses Caffe2 doesn't work anymore.  When I run it, I get this error message:</p>\n<pre><code>ERROR: flag 'help' was defined more than once (in files '/opt/concourse/worker/volumes/live/26a9f68c-5f43-4c42-5672-33448f6eb48d/volume/gflags_1512755328973/work/src/gflags_reporting.cc' and '/tmp/gflags-20170916-46768-ftgkio/gflags-2.2.1/src/gflags_reporting.cc').\n</code></pre>\n<p>Needless to say, neither one of the files it's complaining about a conflict between actually exists on my computer...</p>", "body_text": "Sorry for the delay on this.
