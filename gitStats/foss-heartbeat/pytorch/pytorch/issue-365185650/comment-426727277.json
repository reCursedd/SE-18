I agree with you that the forum is the better place to discuss, but this CTCLoss is a very recent feature that most of the people might not know it exists, as I did. I didn't know whether the higher loss was intended or a bug. So now I understood that the higher loss is came from being averaged by the target lengths, not by the input lengths. Actually I had tried lower initial learning rate but the training was still unstable. I'll do more trials with the parameters. Thanks!</p>", "body_text": "Thanks @t-vi !
