The module is replicated on each machine and each device, and\n+    each such replica handles a portion of the input. During the backwards\n+    pass, gradients from each node are averaged.\n+\n+    The batch size should be larger than the number of GPUs used locally. It should\n+    also be an integer multiple of the number of GPUs so that each chunk is the\n+    same size (so that each GPU processes the same number of samples).\n+\n+    See also: :ref:`cuda-nn-dataparallel-instead`. The same constraints on input\n+    as in :class:`torch.nn.DataParallel` apply.\n+\n+    .. warning::\n+        Constructor, forward method, and differentiation of the output (or a\n+        function of the output of this module) is a distributed synchronization\n+        point.

No parameters should be added nor removed later. Same applies\n+        to buffers.\n+\n+    .. warning::\n+        This module doesn't work with :func:`torch.autograd.grad` (i.e. it will only\n+        work if gradients are to be accumulated in ``.grad`` attributes of parameters).\n+\n+    .. note::\n+        Parameters are never broadcast between processes. The module performs\n+        an all-reduce step on gradients and assumes that they will be modified by the\n+        optimizer in all processes in the same way.
