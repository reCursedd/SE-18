I'm trying to get fastai working on Windows at the moment, and your conda package of pytorch installed flawlessly :) I've got some performance issues - is this the right place to mention them?

I'm using the latest Anaconda Python 3.6 and all packages are updated. Hardware is a new Surface Book 15 inch, GTX1060 mobile GPU. Dual booting to Linux shows 80 seconds to do one forward pass through the Kaggle Dogs &amp; Cats dataset with Resnet50. However the exact same notebook under Windows takes 315 seconds. So about 4x slower under Windows.</p>\n<p>I've used Nvidia control panel to set integrated graphics as default, and confirmed with nvidia-smi nothing else is accessing the nvidia GPU.</p>\n<p>Is this performance difference expected?
