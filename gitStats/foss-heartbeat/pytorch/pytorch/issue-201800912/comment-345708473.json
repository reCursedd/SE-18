So basically rename the .so file to .pyd. I suspected that was the case as I was able to use the \"standard\" ffi on windows (which obviously works since pytorch also uses it). I can write a section to your pytorch build doc about how to build an extension on windows - basically take the example in pytorch docs and show the code changes necessary and the build steps. Let me know if you would like me to do that.</p>", "body_text": "@peterjc123\nThanks that worked. So basically rename the .so file to .pyd.
