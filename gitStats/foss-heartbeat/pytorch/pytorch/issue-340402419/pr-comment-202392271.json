Under a conventional deleter design, you\n+// have to store extra context in the deleter (the metadata pointer) so that\n+// you can actually delete the right thing.  Implementing this with standard\n+// C++ is somewhat error-prone: if you use a std::unique_ptr to manage tensors,\n+// the deleter will not be called if the data pointer is nullptr, which can\n+// cause a leak if the metadata pointer is non-null (and the deleter is\n+// responsible for freeing both the data pointer and the metadata pointer).\n+//\n+// We take a different approach.  The \"metadata supervisor\" situation is common\n+// enough that we have organized our deleter strategy entirely around it:\n+// instead of trying to make the deleter for the data pointer handle all the\n+// heavy lifting, the data pointer is *non-owning*, and instead there is a\n+// (type-erased) supervisor pointer which actually handles deletion.  For simple\n+// cases, the supervisor pointer is the same as the data pointer, but if\n+// there is some extra metadata, the supervisor pointer points there.\n+//\n+// There is something of a pattern to writing these; check THAllocator.{h,cpp}\n+// for some examples.\n+\n+using DeleterFnPtr = void(*)(void*);\n+using SupervisorPtr = std::unique_ptr<void, DeleterFnPtr>;\n+\n+// Does not delete anything\n+AT_API void deleteNothing(void*);\n+// Mints a SupervisorPtr that doesn't do anything.
