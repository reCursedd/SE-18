Under a conventional deleter design, you\n+// have to store extra context in the deleter (the metadata pointer) so that\n+// you can actually delete the right thing.  Implementing this with standard\n+// C++ is somewhat error-prone: if you use a std::unique_ptr to manage tensors,\n+// the deleter will not be called if the data pointer is nullptr, which can\n+// cause a leak if the metadata pointer is non-null (and the deleter is\n+// responsible for freeing both the data pointer and the metadata pointer).\n+//\n+// We take a different approach.  The \"metadata supervisor\" situation is common\n+// enough that we have organized our deleter strategy entirely around it:\n+// instead of trying to make the deleter for the data pointer handle all the\n+// heavy lifting, the data pointer is *non-owning*, and instead there is a\n+// (type-erased) supervisor pointer which actually handles deletion.  For simple\n+// cases, the supervisor pointer is the same as the data pointer, but if\n+// there is some extra metadata, the supervisor pointer points there.\n+//\n+// There is something of a pattern to writing these; check THAllocator.{h,cpp}\n+// for some examples.\n+\n+using DeleterFnPtr = void(*)(void*);\n+using SupervisorPtr = std::unique_ptr<void, DeleterFnPtr>;", "path": "aten/src/ATen/Allocator.h", "position": null, "original_position": 36, "commit_id": "ebbe7907bc313f1d259d85e91bcb72ebafbfd252", "original_commit_id": "1734ec171b326ee5d13adbddc1f7245c353d5e2a", "user": {"login": "gchanan", "id": 3768583, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjM3Njg1ODM=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/3768583?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/gchanan", "html_url": "https://github.com/gchanan", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/gchanan/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/gchanan/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/gchanan/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/gchanan/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/gchanan/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/gchanan/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/gchanan/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/gchanan/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/gchanan/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "body": "Maybe this is a bad idea, but does it make things any simpler if you actually store this as a shared_ptr?
