Here you only pass a single tensor so you can just do <code>batch.data</code>, but sometimes you have a bunch of different tensors as inputs, and it's useful to pass everything to the model inside a namedtuple. This being said, we don't have to fix everything at once.</p>", "body_text": "Hi @Arseny-N, indeed, my idea was that you should be able to pass a namedtuple as an argument to the model directly.
