Can I get a pointer to the model? It will be great if you can comment on places that needs the sparse ops, like the ones you mentioned already: <code>mm</code>, <code>max</code>, <code>softmax</code>.</p>", "body_text": "Hi @gasse, I also want to help you to make your Graph Convolutional Networks work with SparseTensor.
