However, that particular approach takes the Cholesky factorization so it requires that the input be PSD. If your googling got you here and you want to do this on general matrices, you'd have to either do <code>torch.eig</code> and then massage the complex eigenvalues together or just use numpy.</p>", "body_text": "Thanks @KaiyangZhou !
