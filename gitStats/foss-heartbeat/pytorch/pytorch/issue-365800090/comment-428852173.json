Unfortunately due to a non disclosure agreement, I am not allowed to upload code or parts of the code. But I found the solution. I was using a custom collate function for dataloader and one of the variables was initialized wrong. I was copying a tensor (index wise) to another, based on the indices in the wrongly initialized variable right before the conv3d layer. So it was more like an \"out of range\" error or something and I was confused by the CUDNN_STATUS_NOT_INITIALIZED error statement.</p>", "body_text": "@zou3519  Thank you for the reply.
