When you call Engine::execute(), you want to block until autograd\n+//  execution finishes so that you can get the final result variables\n+//  of the backwards pass.\n+//\n+//  2. Autograd execution operates by having a *single* worker assigned\n+//  for any given task (based on the device the task it will run on),\n+//  which is responsible for executing the contents of the task.\n+//\n+// The problem is, suppose that you call backward() inside of a worker\n+// thread.  By property (1), we're supposed to block until the nested task\n+// finishes.  However, by property (2), this worker thread is on the\n+// hook for processing the tasks assigned to it; we better not block,\n+// because then all of our backward executions (including the one we\n+// just started) will deadlock!\n+//\n+// Here's our cunning idea: instead of blocking, just get back to work\n+// on whatever task queue you should have been working on previously\n+// (this is saved via the TLS variable worker_device)!
