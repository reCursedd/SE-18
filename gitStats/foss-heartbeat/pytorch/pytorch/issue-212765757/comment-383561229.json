It is a main reason for many oom problem. But I didn't find the problem of my network. When I train my network without validation( image transformation network), the memory of GPU is stable  all the time. But when there is a validation step, the memory of my first GPU( validation on that GPU) will raise twice.<br>\nFor example, at the beginning of my first epoch, my Gpu memory consume 7G, then change to 9G after the first epoch over with the beginning of validation.  After validation to the second epoch, the memory consuming become 10G. Since then the memory stabilize.  I am very confused...</p>", "body_text": "@tabibusairam Thank you very much, firstly.
