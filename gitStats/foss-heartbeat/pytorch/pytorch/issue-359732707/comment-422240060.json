I wonder if we could have a way to have some kind of embedding bag with our own \"mode\" (that would just take a function or a string, if string then has to be one specified if function then can be whatever you want). Taking advantage of how embedding bag does the embedding (ie. using 1D tensor with offset as well as some memory advantage) while using our own functions. Maybe only part of it would really be totally optimized (ie. mean, sum, max) but overall it would make it easier for everyone and potentially execute faster than padding the sequence and using mask.</p>", "body_text": "Awesome thank you SsnL.
