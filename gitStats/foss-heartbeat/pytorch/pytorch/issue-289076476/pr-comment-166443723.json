ONNX has only one representation,\n+//   corresponding to pytorch's \"padded\". Therefore, we need to remove\n+//   any use of packed sequences before exporting.\n+//\n+// What this does:\n+//\n+//   This code uses the observation that\n+//     RNN(PackPadded(x)) == PackPadded(RNN(x))\n+//   and converts the first form to the second whenever possible,\n+//   \"pushing\" the packing operation past the RNN operation. Then,\n+//   the removeNopPacking pass removes the packing operations\n+//   entirely by pairing them with their inverse PadPacked. If the\n+//   input graph does not pair the operations, export will fail.\n+void pushPackingPastRnn(std::shared_ptr<Graph>& graph) {\n+  for (auto it = graph->nodes().begin(); it != graph->nodes().end(); ++it) {\n+    auto* n = *it;\n+\n+    if (n->kind() != kPackPadded) {\n+      continue;\n+    }\n+    if (n->outputs()[0]->uses().size() != 1) {\n+      // For now, only handle the case where there is one consumer.\n+      continue;\n+    }\n+    Node * rnn = n->outputs()[0]->uses()[0].user;\n+    if (!isRNN(rnn)) {\n+      continue;\n+    }\n+\n+    // remove PackPadded from in front of the RNN\n+    n->outputs()[0]->replaceFirstUseWith(n->inputs()[0]);\n+    n->outputs()[1]->replaceFirstUseWith(n->inputs()[1]);", "path": "torch/csrc/jit/passes/onnx/peephole.cpp", "position": null, "original_position": 50, "commit_id": "c9c0a5924fdbb682f43d1e499db132b5babdba72", "original_commit_id": "789dac8436892d861f60247d245bb8181eaef765", "user": {"login": "ezyang", "id": 13564, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjEzNTY0", "avatar_url": "https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/13564?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/ezyang", "html_url": "https://github.com/ezyang", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ezyang/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ezyang/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ezyang/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ezyang/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ezyang/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ezyang/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ezyang/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ezyang/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ezyang/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "body": "Should there be an ASSERT that `n->outputs()[1]` is used only once?", "created_at": "2018-02-06T21:13:59Z", "updated_at": "2018-11-23T15:39:14Z", "html_url": "https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/pull/4695#discussion_r166443723", "pull_request_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/pytorch/pytorch/pulls/4695", "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR", "_links": {"self": {"href": "https://api.github.com/repos/pytorch/pytorch/pulls/comments/166443723"}, "html": {"href": "https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/pull/4695#discussion_r166443723"}, "pull_request": {"href": "https://api.github.com/repos/pytorch/pytorch/pulls/4695"}}, "body_html": "<p>Should there be an ASSERT that <code>n-&gt;outputs()[1]</code> is used only once?</p>", "body_text": "Should there be an ASSERT that n->outputs()[1] is used only once?"}
