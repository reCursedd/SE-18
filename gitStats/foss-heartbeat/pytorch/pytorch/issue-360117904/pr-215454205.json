When I was creating the custom op API, I created `torch/op.h` as the one-stop header for creating custom ops. I now notice that there is no good header for the TorchScript C++ story altogether, i.e. when you just want to load a script module in C++ without any custom ops necessarily. The `torch/op.h` header suits that purpose just as well of course, but I think we should rename it to `torch/script.h`, which seems like a great name for this feature.\r\n\r\n2. The current API for the CMake we provided was that we defined a bunch of variables like `TORCH_LIBRARY_DIRS` and `TORCH_INCLUDES` and then expected users to add those variables to their targets. We also had a CMake function that did that for you automatically. I now realized a much smarter way of doing this is to create an `IMPORTED` target for the libtorch library in CMake, and then add all this stuff to the link interface of that target. Then all downstream users have to do is `target_link_libraries(my_target torch)` and they get all the proper includes, libraries and compiler flags added to their target. This means we can get rid of the CMake function and all that stuff. @orionr  AFAIK this is a much, much better way of doing all of this, no?\r\n\r\n3. Since we distribute libtorch with `D_GLIBCXX_USE_CXX11_ABI=0`, dependent libraries must set this flag too. I now add this to the interface compile options of this imported target.\r\n\r\n4. Fixes to JIT docs.\r\n\r\nThese could likely be 4 different PRs but given the release I wouldn't mind landing them all asap.\r\n\r\n@zdevito @dzhulgakov @soumith ", "created_at":
