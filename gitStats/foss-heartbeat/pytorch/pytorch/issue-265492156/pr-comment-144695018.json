If it's a callable, it will be called with\n-    two arguments: storage and location tag. It's expected to either return a\n-    storage that's been moved to a different location, or None (and the location\n-    will be resolved using the default method). If this argument is a dict it's\n-    expected to be a mapping from location tags used in a file, to location\n-    tags of the current system.\n-\n-    By default the location tags are 'cpu' for host tensors and 'cuda:device_id'\n-    (e.g. 'cuda:2') for cuda tensors. User extensions can register their own\n+    torch.load uses python's normal unpickling facilities but treats storages,\n+    which underlie tensors, specially.  Storages are first deserialized on the\n+    cpu.  Then, by default, torch.load tries to move the storage to the device\n+    it was saved from, raising an exception if this fails because the device\n+    does not exist.
