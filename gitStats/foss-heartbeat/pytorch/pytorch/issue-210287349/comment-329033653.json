However, word_language_model has a fixed number of layers, which means that ONNX exports it in unrolled form. A bit more design work (and ONNX standardization) would be needed before we can export more dynamic RNN structures, so I would say this is lower priority for the short term.</p>", "body_text": "Hi @ryanleary!
