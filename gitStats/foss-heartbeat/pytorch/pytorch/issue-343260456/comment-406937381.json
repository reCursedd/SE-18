It turns out that they dispatches to series of slicing calls (see <a class=\"issue-link js-issue-link\" data-error-text=\"Failed to load issue title\" data-id=\"343482514\" data-permission-text=\"Issue title is private\" data-url=\"https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/issues/9701\" data-hovercard-type=\"issue\" data-hovercard-url=\"/pytorch/pytorch/issues/9701/hovercard\" href=\"https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/issues/9701\">#9701</a> ). :) So it's fine to do a loop over <code>ndim</code>. Putting this in cpp has the advantage of being faster and benefiting our cpp API users. Are there any other difficulties?</p>", "body_text": "@ailzhang So I looked into how multidim slicing is done on python tensors.
