BUT it relies on the idea that you'll call these functions as default arguments, which doesn't work because our runtime_error does printf style formatting (varags + default arguments don't work well). So we'll have to do with the macro, unless we want to use stringstreams for pre-formatting (I'd rather not, I think the macro is sort of ok, given we also have AT_ASSERT).\nCurrently, all error messages, even when shown in Python, will have this source location:\n\nMy next PR will create an exception subclass that only stores this source information, along with the stacktrace, so we'll be able to conditionally show the information based on the error. Let me know if you think it's a good idea to always show the location, or only in errors from the autograd engine.\nI'll also make a codemod sometime later that replaces throw std::runtime_error with our error class.\n@apaszke @ezyang @colesbury\nCC @ebetica", "merged": true, "mergeable": null, "rebaseable": null, "mergeable_state": "unknown", "merged_by": {"login": "apaszke", "id": 4583066, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjQ1ODMwNjY=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/4583066?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/apaszke", "html_url": "https://github.com/apaszke", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/apaszke/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/apaszke/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/apaszke/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/apaszke/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/apaszke/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/apaszke/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/apaszke/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/apaszke/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/apaszke/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "comments": 3, "review_comments": 13, "maintainer_can_modify": false, "commits": 11, "additions": 286, "deletions": 195, "changed_files": 35}
