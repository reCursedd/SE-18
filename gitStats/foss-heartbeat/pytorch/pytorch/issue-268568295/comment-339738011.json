However, when you use a tensor constructor, you explicitly agree on what the type should be, so casting the array to whatever is needed is a reasonable decision\n\n\u2014\nYou are receiving this because you were mentioned.\nReply to this email directly, view it on GitHub&lt;<a class=\"issue-link js-issue-link\" data-error-text=\"Failed to load issue title\" data-id=\"268568295\" data-permission-text=\"Issue title is private\" data-url=\"https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/issues/3293\" href=\"https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/issues/3293#issuecomment-339723667\">#3293 (comment)</a>&gt;, or mute the thread&lt;<a href=\"https://github.com/notifications/unsubscribe-auth/AF1_-ejy3frN_4YU1DOWdX-dynmFJNq1ks5swLPygaJpZM4QGvjN\">https://github.com/notifications/unsubscribe-auth/AF1_-ejy3frN_4YU1DOWdX-dynmFJNq1ks5swLPygaJpZM4QGvjN</a>&gt;.</div>\n</div>", "body_text": "maybe I am misunderstanding \"you explicitly agree on what the type should be\" ?   with torch.Tensor(numpy_array) ?\n\u2026\n________________________________\nFrom: Adam Paszke <notifications@github.com>\nSent: Thursday, October 26, 2017 12:31:46 PM\nTo: pytorch/pytorch\nCc: Arthur Szlam; Mention\nSubject: Re: [pytorch/pytorch] Tensor constructor passed numpy ndarray does not check type.
