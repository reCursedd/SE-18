However, if we just apply these fixes, the resulting index from running the repro case becomes:\n-> 0, 0, 7, 0\nwhich is still wrong.\nThe reason for this is that when reducing over the results of the threads in the kernel, the arguments are passed as early in the array as first argument, late in the array as second argument.\nThis leads to the fix in kernelTransformReduceInnermostDimIndex.\nAn alternative fix would be to  keep everything that I've changed as it was and swap the order of the arguments here and here. This would probably be cleaner.\nLet me know what you think.Should I add a test for this?\nEDIT: I actually went ahead and  did the alternate fix. I find it cleaner.", "merged": false, "mergeable": null, "rebaseable": null, "mergeable_state": "unknown", "merged_by": null, "comments": 4, "review_comments": 0, "maintainer_can_modify": false, "commits": 2, "additions": 3, "deletions": 3, "changed_files": 1}
