Since PyTorch still sees your GPU 0 as first in CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES, it will create some context on it. If you want your script to completely ignore GPU 0, you need to set that environment variable. e.g., for it to only use GPU 5, do <code>CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=5 python my_script.py</code>. However, be noted that in the script GPU 5 is really referred to as device 0.</p>", "body_text": "@lucylw Yes this is the intended behavior.
