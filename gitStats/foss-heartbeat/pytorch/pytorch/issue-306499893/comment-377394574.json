Currently we don't do it since we spawn 3 processes in Gloo test( it's 2 in NCCL tests), so we will need at least 3 GPUs to test it together with the new_group(which requires 3 processes) in Gloo. It's actually good to change it when we have &gt;2 GPUs in our test environment. Is it already up online?</p>", "body_text": "@ezyang We can change these tests to actually use multi gpus for testing.
