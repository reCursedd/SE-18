Indexing a single dimension of multi-dimensional arrays is slower than it should be because it expands the indexing tensor to individual elements. This should be fixed.\r\n2. `index_select` has an incorrect gradient when indices repeat. That's why `put` with `accumulate=True` is slower than `put` with `accumulate=False`.
