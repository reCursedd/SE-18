The problem is that, as pointed in the paper mentioned above, the learnable parameters gamma and beta should be shared between these BN modules. Only the running_mean and running_var should be differentiated by the iterations. If do it in this way, how do we force them to share the learnable weights gamma and beta? <a class=\"user-mention\" data-hovercard-type=\"user\" data-hovercard-url=\"/hovercards?user_id=1310570\" data-octo-click=\"hovercard-link-click\" data-octo-dimensions=\"link_type:self\" href=\"https://github.com/soumith\">@soumith</a></p>", "body_text": "Thanks for the reply.
