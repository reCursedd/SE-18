Each std::shared_ptr<Function> contains a list of Edge, and\n+ * each Edge contains a std::shared_ptr<Function>. Deleting a\n+ * std::shared_ptr<Function> can trigger the recursive deletion of other\n+ * std::shared_ptr<Function>'s: this can stack overflow if the graph\n+ * is deep enough. Here is an example of such a graph:\n+ *\n+ * shared_ptr<Function> -> Edge -> shared_ptr<Function> -> Edge -> ... -> shared_ptr<Function>\n+ *\n+ * The solution here is to use a custom deleter with each\n+ * std::shared_ptr<Function>. The custom deleter keeps track of how many\n+ * nested deleters it is in. When this number exceeds the maximum allowed\n+ * depth, the Function* to be deleted are accumulated in a per-thread\n+ * delete queue and handled by one of the deleters.\n+ */\n+thread_local std::deque<Function*> kDeleteFunctionQueue;\n+\n+constexpr size_t kDeleteFunctionMaxRecursionDepth = 10000;\n+thread_local size_t kDeleteFunctionRecursionDepth = 0;", "path": "torch/csrc/autograd/function.cpp", "position": null, "original_position": 33, "commit_id": "92adc80cb73a1748ab2cb0cbe4eb50df38b7b051", "original_commit_id": "2bc1f600394d258546418040c895dafe7c972cbd", "user": {"login": "ezyang", "id": 13564, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjEzNTY0", "avatar_url": "https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/13564?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/ezyang", "html_url": "https://github.com/ezyang", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ezyang/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ezyang/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ezyang/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ezyang/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ezyang/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ezyang/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ezyang/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ezyang/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ezyang/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "body": "It's a bit weird to use the k-convention here.\r\n\r\nIn the Google C++ style guide, https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html#Constant_Names the k-prefix is reserved for variables which are constant for the entire duration of the program.
