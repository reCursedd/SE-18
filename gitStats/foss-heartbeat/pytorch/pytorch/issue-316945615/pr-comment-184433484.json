Each std::shared_ptr<Function> contains a list of Edge, and\n+ * each Edge contains a std::shared_ptr<Function>. Deleting a\n+ * std::shared_ptr<Function> can trigger the recursive deletion of other\n+ * std::shared_ptr<Function>'s: this can stack overflow if the graph\n+ * is deep enough. Here is an example of such a graph:\n+ *\n+ * shared_ptr<Function> -> Edge -> shared_ptr<Function> -> Edge -> ... -> shared_ptr<Function>\n+ *\n+ * The solution here is to use a custom deleter with each\n+ * std::shared_ptr<Function>. The custom deleter keeps track of how many\n+ * nested deleters it is in. When this number exceeds the maximum allowed\n+ * depth, the Function* to be deleted are accumulated in a per-thread\n+ * delete queue and handled by one of the deleters.\n+ */\n+thread_local std::deque<Function*> kDeleteFunctionQueue;\n+\n+constexpr size_t kDeleteFunctionMaxRecursionDepth = 10000;\n+thread_local size_t kDeleteFunctionRecursionDepth = 0;\n+\n+struct RecursionDepthCounter {\n+ public:\n+  explicit RecursionDepthCounter() {\n+    ++kDeleteFunctionRecursionDepth;\n+  }\n+  ~RecursionDepthCounter() {\n+    --kDeleteFunctionRecursionDepth;\n+  }\n+\n+  size_t value() {\n+    return kDeleteFunctionRecursionDepth;\n+  }\n+};\n+\n+void deleteFunction(Function* function) {\n+  RecursionDepthCounter recursion_depth;\n+\n+  if (recursion_depth.value() > kDeleteFunctionMaxRecursionDepth) {\n+    kDeleteFunctionQueue.push_back(function);\n+    return;\n+  }\n+\n+  delete function;\n+\n+  if (kDeleteFunctionQueue.size() == 0) {\n+    return;\n+  }\n+  if (recursion_depth.value() != kDeleteFunctionMaxRecursionDepth) {\n+    AT_ERROR(\"Only one deleter per thread should be able to process \"\n+             \"the delete queue.
