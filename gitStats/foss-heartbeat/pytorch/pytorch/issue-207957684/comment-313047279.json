Why it has dependency on thrust in <code>Traits.hpp</code>?. This will cause error when compiling without cuda. Is it possible to only use like  or &lt;complex.h&gt; in <code>Traits.hpp</code>? I haven't figure it out. Maybe you could offer some clues?</p>", "body_text": "@PhilippPelz Hi, I'm quite confused about THPP part you implemented. Why it has dependency on thrust in Traits.hpp?.
