It fixes reduce kernels where accum type != type. Currently, for example, half tensors with small values may have norms that are (approximately) representable in fp16, but calling .norm() on them will result in underflow and a reported norm of zero. This PR fixes that behavior and adds a test in test_cuda.py to ensure underflow does not occur (test_tiny_half_norm). \r\n\r\n2. It simplifies all reductions by removing excessive templating and the -2 contiguous special case from THC_reduceDim and THC_reduceAll. The latter was previously removed from pointwise apply. This has no performance impact as the -2 special case was already mapping to the 1D code path.\r\n\r\nPyTorch currently attempts to handle accum type != type by either (1) writing kernels that immediately convert values to accum type after reading or (2) writing operations that take in type values and accumulate to the accum type. The latter path was not working properly (hence the current excessive half tensor underflow) and resulted in a lot of redundant code, with two reduce ops being passed to a kernel instead of one, and reduce ops frequently receiving the same template argument twice.\r\n\r\nThis PR makes the former approach THE approach. Kernels that accumulate to (potentially) different types should follow the pattern of converting their input to the accum type, performing all operations on that type, and then converting back to the appropriate type if writing their value back to the tensor. This pattern makes the second reduce op redundant and allows for simpler templating, which should improve readability, reduce build time, and reduce binary size. Also, this prevents ops from having to perform their own conversions, which could result in poor performance if the same value was operated on multiple times.\r\n\r\nOne exception to this simplification was that a new ThrustTensorDistOp was created to handle a call to thrust::inner_product(). This Op fuses the conversion and the TensorDistOp.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the expected simplification, there is also some cleanup of excessive template parameters. For example, kernelReduceAllPass2() had three template parameters: T, IndexType, and ReduceOp, but IndexType was never used.\r\n\r\n", "created_at": "2018-05-10T23:04:51Z", "updated_at":

For example, kernelReduceAllPass2() had three template parameters: T, IndexType, and ReduceOp, but IndexType was never used.</p>", "body_text": "This PR makes two improvements:\n\n\nIt fixes reduce kernels where accum type != type. Currently, for example, half tensors with small values may have norms that are (approximately) representable in fp16, but calling .norm() on them will result in underflow and a reported norm of zero. This PR fixes that behavior and adds a test in test_cuda.py to ensure underflow does not occur (test_tiny_half_norm).\n\n\nIt simplifies all reductions by removing excessive templating and the -2 contiguous special case from THC_reduceDim and THC_reduceAll. The latter was previously removed from pointwise apply. This has no performance impact as the -2 special case was already mapping to the 1D code path.\n\n\nPyTorch currently attempts to handle accum type != type by either (1) writing kernels that immediately convert values to accum type after reading or (2) writing operations that take in type values and accumulate to the accum type. The latter path was not working properly (hence the current excessive half tensor underflow) and resulted in a lot of redundant code, with two reduce ops being passed to a kernel instead of one, and reduce ops frequently receiving the same template argument twice.\nThis PR makes the former approach THE approach. Kernels that accumulate to (potentially) different types should follow the pattern of converting their input to the accum type, performing all operations on that type, and then converting back to the appropriate type if writing their value back to the tensor. This pattern makes the second reduce op redundant and allows for simpler templating, which should improve readability, reduce build time, and reduce binary size. Also, this prevents ops from having to perform their own conversions, which could result in poor performance if the same value was operated on multiple times.\nOne exception to this simplification was that a new ThrustTensorDistOp was created to handle a call to thrust::inner_product(). This Op fuses the conversion and the TensorDistOp.\nIn addition to the expected simplification, there is also some cleanup of excessive template parameters. For example, kernelReduceAllPass2() had three template parameters: T, IndexType, and ReduceOp, but IndexType was never used.", "merged": true, "mergeable": null, "rebaseable": null, "mergeable_state": "unknown", "merged_by": {"login": "ezyang", "id": 13564, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjEzNTY0", "avatar_url": "https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/13564?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/ezyang", "html_url": "https://github.com/ezyang", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ezyang/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ezyang/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ezyang/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ezyang/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ezyang/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ezyang/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ezyang/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ezyang/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ezyang/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "comments": 8, "review_comments": 11, "maintainer_can_modify": false, "commits": 5, "additions": 489, "deletions": 583, "changed_files": 12}
