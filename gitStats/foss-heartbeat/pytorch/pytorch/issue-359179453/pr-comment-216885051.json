Each std::shared_ptr<Function> contains a list of Edge, and\n- * each Edge contains a std::shared_ptr<Function>. Deleting a\n- * std::shared_ptr<Function> can trigger the recursive deletion of other\n- * std::shared_ptr<Function>'s: this can stack overflow if the graph\n- * is deep enough. Here is an example of such a graph:\n- *\n- * shared_ptr<Function> -> Edge -> shared_ptr<Function> -> Edge -> ... -> shared_ptr<Function>\n- *\n- * The solution here is to use a custom deleter with each\n- * std::shared_ptr<Function>. The custom deleter keeps track of how many\n- * nested deleters it is in. When this number exceeds the maximum allowed\n- * depth, the Function* to be deleted are accumulated in a per-thread\n- * delete queue and handled by one of the deleters.\n- *\n- * Note that these custom deleters are NOT necessary for deleting PyFunction.\n- * This is because a THPFunction Python object owns a PyFunction that is in a\n- * computation graph. When Python objects get recursively destroyed, they\n- * are also queued into a delete list. This happens very early for them\n- * (at 50 deleters): https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/f320be77ffb73e3b9e7fc98c37b8df3975d84b40/Include/object.h#L1024-L1063\n- * so we don't need to worry about them.\n- */\n-\n-thread_local std::deque<Function*> deleteFunctionQueue;\n-thread_local size_t deleteFunctionRecursionDepth = 0;\n-\n-/*\n- * If this number is set too high, a deep computation graph can still\n- * stack overflow. The procedure for setting this number was to\n- * 1) find the smallest value that would not guard against stack overflows\n- *    on various machines\n- * 2) Take the minimum of all such values and subtract some leeway because\n- *    the memory of these stack frames will probably grow as time passes.\n- * Testing on a few machines machines, the magic numbers were:\n- * - Mac OSX (Macbook Pro 15) : ~60000\n- * - A beefy Ubuntu 16.04 box : ~15000\n- * - Windows AWS instance (g3.4xlarge): variable.
