It is not hard to replace openmp with tbb. But the code of <code>THTensor_(bernoulli)</code>  has not been adapted in OOP. The code will be not elegant if we modify the code with tbb. If PyTorch plans to rewrite the module, I think it is easy to use tbb instead of openmp.<br>\nActually, I am more concerned with the 'chaos' phenomenon of <code>bernoulli</code> and <code>bernoulli_</code>.
