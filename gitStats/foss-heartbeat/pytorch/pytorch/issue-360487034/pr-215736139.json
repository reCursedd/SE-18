This means that calling `load` or `load_inline` (i.e. building a JIT C++ extension) with the same C++ extension name twice in the same Python process will never re-load the library, even if the compiled source code and the underlying shared library have changed. The only way to circumvent this is to create a new library and load it under a new module name.\r\n\r\nI fix this, of course, by introducing a layer of indirection. Loading a JIT C++ extension now goes through an `ExtensionVersioner`, which hashes the contents of the source files as well as build flags, and if this hash changed, bumps an internal version stored for each module name. A bump in the version will result in the ninja file being edited and a new shared library and effectively a new C++ extension to be compiled. For this the version name is appended as `_v<version>` to the extension name for all versions greater zero.\r\n\r\nOne caveat is that if you were to update your code many times and always re-load it in the same process, you may end up with quite a lot of shared library objects in your extension's folder under `/tmp`. I imagine this isn't too bad, since extensions are typically small and there isn't really a good way for us to garbage collect old libraries, since we don't know what still has handles to them.\r\n\r\nFixes https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/issues/11398 CC @t-vi \r\n\r\n@ezyang @gchanan @soumith @fmassa ", "created_at": "2018-09-14T23:59:45Z", "updated_at": "2018-09-20T21:44:31Z",
