For now , its still simple since it ends up to a max of three executions of the compiler.  But it becomes more complicated as you add more flags in the future.  I'm OK either way,  all I need is to get this to work on ppc64le.  Let me know what you decide.</p>", "body_text": "@ezyang I saw the commit, while it's nice to have a dynamic way to figure out which flag works or not for different architectures, once you start adding more flags that you want to test , then you end up running the compile several iterations to find which combinations of flags work.
