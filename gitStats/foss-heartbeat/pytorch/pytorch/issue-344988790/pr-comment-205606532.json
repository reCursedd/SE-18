All integer values are serialized as little-endian.\n+// Everything in this format is aligned to 64-byte boundaries to allow for direct\n+// memory mapping and use in, for example, AVX512 instructions.\n+// The format is as follows:\n+//\n+// -- File header --\n+// [8 bytes] Magic number - little endian integer that spells 'PYTORCH1' in ASCII\n+// [8 bytes] Version number - The version of this file format that this file is in.\n+//                            this allows us to revise and extend this format\n+// [56 bytes] Padding/reserved\n+//\n+// After the file header reside N records of the format\n+// [8 bytes] Tag - this is a tag that identifies the type of this record. The\n+//                 values are defined in the RecordTags enum below.\n+// [8 bytes] size - Size in bytes of the payload of this record\n+// [56 bytes] Pad/reserved - This space pads out the payload to a 64-byte alignment.\n+// [size bytes] Payload - The actual raw data for the object serialized in this record\n+// [size - (size % 64) bytes] Pad/reserved - pad out this record so the next\n+//                                                one is aligned to 64 bytes\n+//\n+// Following those records is a special footer:\n+// [8 bytes] Tag - This tag field should contain the value for RecordTags::FOOTER\n+//                 to correctly identify the footer\n+// [8 bytes] Offset of last record - The last record in this format is used\n+//                                   as an index into the rest of the file, so\n+//                                   a reader can use this offset to seek to\n+//                                   the last record and read the index.\n+// [56 bytes] Pad/reserved - Pad out the footer s.t. the whole file's size is a\n+//                           multiple of 64 bytes.\n+//\n+//\n+// When developing this format we want to pay particular attention to the\n+// following use cases:\n+//\n+// -- Reading --\n+// 1) Reading with full random access\n+//   a) Reading with file api's such as fread()\n+//   b) mmaping the file and jumping around the mapped region\n+// 2) Reading with 1-pass sequential access\n+//      -> A reader will need to build up a data structure of parsed structures\n+//         as it reads\n+//\n+// -- Writing --\n+// 1) Writing with full random access\n+// 2) Writing with 1-pass sequential access\n+//      -> We must take care not to require updating values that have already\n+//         been written.
