Splitting such files into separate files helps.\n   (Example: `THTensorMath`, `THTensorMoreMath`, `THTensorEvenMoreMath`.)\n \n+### Running Clang-Tidy\n+\n+[Clang-Tidy](https://clang.llvm.org/extra/clang-tidy/index.html) is a C++\n+linter and static analysis tool based on the clang compiler. We run clang-tidy\n+in our CI to make sure that new C++ code is safe, sane and efficient. See our\n+[.travis.yml](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/master/.travis.yml) file\n+for the simple commands we use for this.\n+\n+To run clang-tidy locally, follow these steps:\n+\n+1. Install clang-tidy. First, check if you already have clang-tidy by simply\n+writing `clang-tidy` in your terminal. If you don't yet have clang-tidy, you\n+should be able to install it easily with your package manager, e.g. by writing\n+`apt-get install clang-tidy` on Ubuntu. See https://apt.llvm.org for details on\n+how to install the latest version. Note that newer versions of clang-tidy will\n+have more checks than older versions. In our CI, we run clang-tidy-6.0.\n+\n+2.
