We run clang-tidy\n+in our CI to make sure that new C++ code is safe, sane and efficient. See our\n+[.travis.yml](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/master/.travis.yml) file\n+for the simple commands we use for this.\n+\n+To run clang-tidy locally, follow these steps:\n+\n+1. Install clang-tidy. First, check if you already have clang-tidy by simply\n+writing `clang-tidy` in your terminal. If you don't yet have clang-tidy, you\n+should be able to install it easily with your package manager, e.g. by writing\n+`apt-get install clang-tidy` on Ubuntu. See https://apt.llvm.org for details on\n+how to install the latest version. Note that newer versions of clang-tidy will\n+have more checks than older versions. In our CI, we run clang-tidy-6.0.", "path": "CONTRIBUTING.md", "position": 19, "original_position": 19, "commit_id": "e38318e62aa1660faf1382016d4ed649c73c6e21", "original_commit_id": "5564d8c0af37d74bd9ff0f19d083d065244acc08", "user": {"login": "ezyang", "id": 13564, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjEzNTY0", "avatar_url": "https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/13564?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/ezyang", "html_url": "https://github.com/ezyang", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ezyang/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ezyang/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ezyang/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ezyang/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ezyang/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ezyang/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ezyang/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ezyang/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ezyang/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "body": "This is a bit provincial, but most of the core devs don't run Ubuntu on their main devserver.
