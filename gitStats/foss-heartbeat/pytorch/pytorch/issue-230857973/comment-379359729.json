Our tool chains are mainly around PyTorch and our models work very efficiently with data-parallelism training. So if threadripper works, it should be an ideal platform for Quad GPU PyTorch learning box. Based on your suggestion, I got Supernova 1600. The GPUs are all 1080Ti FE cards. I will update my experience once I got my PyTorch working on this box. Or if I got issues, I may come back to ask for further suggestions.</p>", "body_text": "@dmitry-xnor Great!
