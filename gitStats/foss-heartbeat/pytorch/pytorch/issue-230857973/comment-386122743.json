The recently released linux 16.04.4 LTS works with 1950x smoothly. I did have to turn off an energy saving feature in the kernel, but that's actually good for a server. The whole build works well with PyTorch and I was glad that I used 1950x rather than 1920 since Pytorch uses MAGMA library to handle some of the linalg functions like symeig and svd. MAGMA uses CPU heavily for these functions and a fast CPU is very necessary. However, even I use 1950x, the CPU is still a bottleneck if I run several such processes independently. I hope in the future PyTorch can provide an option run svd and symeig on GPUs only. I think the whole system is working quite stably now and Further I suggest to add two additional fans to cool the GPUs properly.</p>", "body_text": "@awaelchli @dmitry-xnor An update on the trheadripper 1950x build.
