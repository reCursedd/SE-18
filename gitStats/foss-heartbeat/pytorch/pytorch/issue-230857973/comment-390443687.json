The sysbench gives really good score. But when it comes to the linear algebra with both numpy and pytorch on CPU, the performance of 1950x is even much slower than i7-6700k, not even comparable to i9-7920x. I'm using anaconda + pytorch 0.3. I think it's the software issue that mkl and openblas doesn't support threadripper well. Given you guys are also using threadripper for machine learning, I wonder how did you solve this problem. Would you give me some further suggestions? Thanks a lot!</p>", "body_text": "@dmitry-xnor @awaelchli Hi, recently I did some detailed benchmarks with 1950x. The sysbench gives really good score.
