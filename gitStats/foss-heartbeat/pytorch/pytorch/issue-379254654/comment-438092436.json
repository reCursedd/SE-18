Maybe it's worth create a place in PyTorch to put utility functions for quantization. This later can be used by the interface Greg and Yiming are designing. We can also put the utility functions in fbgemm. Please let us know which one makes more sense.</p>", "body_text": "Just looked at more details to have a better understanding.
