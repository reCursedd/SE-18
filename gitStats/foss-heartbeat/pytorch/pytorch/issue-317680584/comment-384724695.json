Very interesting to hear about the history of the initialization and the empirical results. I'd be curious to know what benchmarks this initialization performed better on. Just a thought: it might be worth making the documentation a bit more clear about this caveat (if it is documented somewhere already, my apologies!), because I suspect people would in general assume that the initialization is something more standard. The improvement in performance might not generalize to some people's specific tasks, and the fact that the default initialization is non-standard might not be immediately obvious. Could cause some unnecessary consternation for some people.</p>", "body_text": "@apaszke @soumith Thanks for your responses!
