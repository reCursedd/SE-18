From what I read, the reverse mode AD (which I presume is used in Pytorch) calculates the gradient of the objective function w.r.t. to the previous layer (and so on). It sounds to me that if the function is <code>y = Wx</code>, it should get <code>W</code> during the calculation? That is more or less the thing I want.</p>", "body_text": "@SsnL I have read more about AD.
