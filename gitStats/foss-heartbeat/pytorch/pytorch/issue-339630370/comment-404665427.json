I can still do forward/backward passes by using the <code>cutorch</code> module but once converted to CuDNN, things break down during forward-passing. Do you think these could be related? Could the recent updates to CuDNN be causing these issues? Have you guys tested the latest version of CuDNN?</p>", "body_text": "@soumith I am getting the exact same error message when trying to do a forward pass on a Lua Torch model after converting its modules to CuDNN modules.
