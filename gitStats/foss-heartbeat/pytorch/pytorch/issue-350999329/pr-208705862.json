The passes were updated to only operate on CPU or CUDA nodes, and the compilers have checks to ensure they're dealing with the correct type. More precisely:\r\n\r\n-Creates a new \"fusers\" directory\r\n-The graph_fuser pass now calls a cpu fusion pass if we can compile on the cpu\r\n-The graph_fuser pass also calls a cuda fusion pass if we're using cuda, not ROCm, and not Windows\r\n-The cuda fuser is only built if using cuda, not ROCm, and not Windows\r\n-The passes now operate only on nodes of their respective types\r\n-The fusers now operate only on nodes of their respective types\r\n-Both fusers have some clean-up refactoring, mostly spinning classes off into their own headers\r\n\r\nThere is no end-user functionality change with this PR, but it sets the stage for further fusion enhancements.\r\n\r\nNote: this PR was spun out of #10544, since it contains additional improvements. Originally it was to diagnose a cpu-only trusty failure in the latter (hence the name \"cuda_fuser_trusty\"). Thanks to @ezyang for being incredibly helpful in diagnosing that issue. Closing #10544 in favor of this branch.\r\n\r\n@csarofeen also contributed to this PR, as can be seen in the history of #10544, which I plundered.", "created_at": "2018-08-15T23:11:11Z", "updated_at":
