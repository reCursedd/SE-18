This design is based on reviews of XLA, TVM, internal design review at NVIDIA and discussions with fuser owners at Facebook. To further vet the design I have begun developing the next significant PR (extended fusion logic) on top of this architecture and it has made the work significantly easier.

Future PRs should be smaller.\r\n\r\nThe fusion flow is now:\r\n\r\n- Fusions are \"registered\" and \"upfront compilation\" occurs. The fusion specifications, which includes the graph, go into a thread-safe device-independent cache.

It also fixes few couple bugs and makes some logical/code changes.\r\n\r\nBug fixes:\r\n- thread-safety is improved with caches preventing concurrent access\r\n- the nvrtc version is now reviewed to determine the appropriate compute architecture to compile for, fixing a bug that would cause runtime errors if a user's nvrtc didn't support the compute architecture their gpu reported\r\n- an issue with DeviceGuard not setting the device properly and failing silently is worked-around (@ezyang mentioned he was reviewing the dynamic registration DeviceGuard uses, which may resolve the issue)\r\n\r\nCode/Logical changes:\r\n- \"const\" now appears many more places (note: I cast const away in operator.h because of some obscure build issues -- I think we should be able to fix this and will take a look while this goes through testing)\r\n- The new flow allowed some redundant code to be removed (AnnotatedGraph is gone, for example, and the more straightforward flow eliminated duplication of effort elsewhere)\r\n- Fallback logic is now also invoked if a fusion is requested on a device that cannot handle fusions\r\n- Use of macros to determine which files are compiled is reduced (though they may come back if the Windows build is unhappy)\r\n- There is no more \"common\" code or folder, the device-independent logic being at the forefront of the fuser replaces and improves upon the goal of sharing code\r\n\r\n@apaszke who I promised naming rights to\r\n@zdevito who correctly pointed out that the device-independent logic should be the bulk of what the fuser is

The current upstream logic is, by contrast, PyTorch IR -> Device-Specific Logic -> Device-Independent Logic, which results in needless code duplication and lack of conceptual clarity. That was my mistake when splitting the fuser off from the rest of the jit and our reviews since then have been incredibly helpful in understanding why the approach in this PR is better.\nThis PR does not only move code around. It also fixes few couple bugs and makes some logical/code changes.\nBug fixes:\n\nthread-safety is improved with caches preventing concurrent access\nthe nvrtc version is now reviewed to determine the appropriate compute architecture to compile for, fixing a bug that would cause runtime errors if a user's nvrtc didn't support the compute architecture their gpu reported\nan issue with DeviceGuard not setting the device properly and failing silently is worked-around (@ezyang mentioned he was reviewing the dynamic registration DeviceGuard uses, which may resolve the issue)\n\nCode/Logical changes:\n\n\"const\" now appears many more places (note: I cast const away in operator.h because of some obscure build issues -- I think we should be able to fix this and will take a look while this goes through testing)\nThe new flow allowed some redundant code to be removed (AnnotatedGraph is gone, for example, and the more straightforward flow eliminated duplication of effort elsewhere)\nFallback logic is now also invoked if a fusion is requested on a device that cannot handle fusions\nUse of macros to determine which files are compiled is reduced (though they may come back if the Windows build is unhappy)\nThere is no more \"common\" code or folder, the device-independent logic being at the forefront of the fuser replaces and improves upon the goal of sharing code\n\n@apaszke who I promised naming rights to\n@zdevito who correctly pointed out that the device-independent logic should be the bulk of what the fuser is doing\n@ngimel who contributed to the design of this architecture", "merged": false, "mergeable": null, "rebaseable": null, "mergeable_state": "unknown", "merged_by": null, "comments": 9, "review_comments": 40, "maintainer_can_modify": false, "commits": 30, "additions": 2208, "deletions": 2113, "changed_files": 61}
