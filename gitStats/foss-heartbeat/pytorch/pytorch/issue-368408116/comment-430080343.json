It seems to me that you're saying that if a variable has ANY influence on another variable outside of no-grad, we should record a gradient. OK... but, by this reasoning principle, isn't <code>detach()</code> also a bad operation? Because a detached variable is sure as heck influenced by the original variable. What makes a detached variable different from a view operation performed inside a no-grad region?</p>", "body_text": "@apaszke, I don't understand what principle you're trying to argue.
