In your example, I don't think it makes much sense to connect <code>x</code> back to <code>z</code> after the block. It feels natural to me that there is not gradient relation between <code>z</code> and <code>y</code> because they only interact through <code>x</code>, which is created in <code>no_grad()</code>. It is still possible to backprop from <code>x</code> to <code>y</code>, which I think is the correct behavior here.</p>", "body_text": "@apaszke I agree with Sam here.
