From what I am understanding so far, one of the biggest advantages from DataParallel is that it allows a model to run at a larger size of minibatch. Say if my GPU0 is only capable of a batch size of 200, but by using DataParallel on two GPUs, it should be roughly 400. Am I right? But in my experiments, I got GPU out of memory error immediately after increasing the batch size. My GPU memory usage is like 90% on GPU0, 20% on the others.</p>", "body_text": "@apaszke Thanks for explaining DataParallel.
