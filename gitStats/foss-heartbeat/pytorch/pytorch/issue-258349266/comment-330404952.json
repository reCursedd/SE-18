And we strongly believe that the value is dependent on specifical CPU platform. We want to provide a benchmark to explain it and hope to set the value according to the CPU when compiling the code. You may want to reproduce the performance of benchmark. But we focus on the performance CPU in servers like Xeon and Xeon phi which have at least 22 cores. I am afraid that these CPUs are unavailuable to you. We also have CPUs in desktop like i7-5960x. I think that you can provide some models of CPU and we will add these models of CPU to our benchmark as far as possible so that you can reproduce the result conveniently.</p>", "body_text": "@soumith As your concern, that the TH_OMP_OVERHEAD_THRESHOLD value is set to 4k is really controversial. 4k is an empirical value from a our previous case.
