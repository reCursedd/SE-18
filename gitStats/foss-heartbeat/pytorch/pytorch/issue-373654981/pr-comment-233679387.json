We are \n+* parallelizing this array by partitioning the huge array and assigning \n+* a thread index to each partition. In other words, each seed value \n+* (there are 2^64 possible seed values) gives a sub array of size \n+* 2^128 (each element in that array is a 128 bit number). Reasoning\n+* behind the array being of size 2^128 is, there are 2^64 possible\n+* thread index value and there is an array of size 2^64 for each of\n+* those thread index. Hence 2^64 * 2^64 = 2^128 for each seed value.\n+*\n+* In short, this generator can produce 2^64 (seed values) * 2^128 (number\n+* of elements in an array given by a seed value) = 2^192 values.\n+*\n+* Arguments:\n+* seed:        Seed values could be any number from 0 to 2^64-1.\n+* subsequence: Subsequence is just the cuda thread indexing with:\n+*              - blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x\n+* offset:      The offset variable in PhiloxEngine  decides how many 128-bit \n+*              random numbers to skip (i.e. how many groups of 4, 32-bit numbers to skip)\n+*              and hence really decides the total number of randoms that can be achieved \n+*              for the given subsequence.\n+*/\n+\n+class philox_engine {\n+public:\n+\n+  /*\n+  * Constructor\n+  */\n+  C10_DEVICE inline philox_engine(unsigned long long seed,\n+                                 unsigned long long subsequence,\n+                                 unsigned long long offset) {\n+    key.x = (unsigned int)seed;\n+    key.y = (unsigned int)(seed >> 32);\n+    counter = make_uint4(0, 0, 0, 0);\n+    counter.z = (unsigned int)(subsequence);\n+    counter.w = (unsigned int)(subsequence >> 32);\n+    STATE = 0;\n+    incr_n(offset);\n+  }\n+\n+  /*\n+  * Produces a unique 32-bit pseudo random number on every invocation\n+  */\n+  C10_DEVICE inline unsigned long operator()() {\n+    if(STATE == 0) {\n+      uint4 counter_ = counter;\n+      uint2 key_ = key;\n+      for(int i = 0; i < 9; i++) {\n+        counter_ = single_round(counter_, key_);\n+        key_.x += (kPhilox10A); key_.y += (kPhilox10B);\n+      }\n+      output = single_round(counter_, key_);\n+      incr();\n+    }\n+    unsigned long ret;\n+    switch(STATE) {\n+      case 0: ret = output.x; break;\n+      case 1: ret = output.y; break;\n+      case 2: ret = output.z; break;\n+      case 3: ret = output.w; break;\n+    }\n+    STATE = (STATE + 1) % 4;\n+    return ret;\n+  }\n+\n+  /*\n+  * Function that Skips N 128 bit numbers in a subsequence\n+  */\n+  C10_DEVICE inline void incr_n(unsigned long long n) {\n+    unsigned int nlo = (unsigned int)(n);\n+    unsigned int nhi = (unsigned int)(n >> 32);\n+    counter.x += nlo;\n+    if (counter.x < nlo) {\n+      // if overflow in x has occured, carry over to nhi\n+      unsigned int nhi_old = nhi;\n+      nhi++;\n+      counter.y += nhi;\n+      if(nhi_old <= nhi) {\n+        // if overflow in nhi has occured during carry over,\n+        // propagate that overflow to y and exit to increment z\n+        // otherwise return\n+        if (nhi <= counter.y) {\n+          return;\n+        }\n+      }\n+    } else {\n+      // if overflow in y has occured during addition,\n+      // exit to increment z\n+      // otherwise return\n+      counter.y += nhi;\n+      if (nhi <= counter.y) {\n+        return;\n+      }\n+    }\n+    if (++counter.z)\n+      return;\n+    ++counter.w;\n+  }\n+\n+  /*\n+  * Function that Skips one 128 bit number in a subsequence\n+  */\n+  C10_DEVICE inline void incr() {\n+    if (++counter.x)\n+      return;\n+    if (++counter.y)\n+      return;\n+    if (++counter.z) {\n+      return;\n+    }\n+    ++counter.w;\n+  }\n+\n+private:\n+  uint4 counter;\n+  uint4 output;\n+  uint2 key;\n+  unsigned int STATE;\n+\n+  C10_DEVICE unsigned int mulhilo32(unsigned int a, unsigned int b,\n+                                    unsigned int *result_high) {\n+    *result_high = __umulhi(a, b);\n+    return a*b;\n+  }\n+\n+  C10_DEVICE inline uint4 single_round(uint4 ctr, uint2 key) {\n+    unsigned int hi0;\n+    unsigned int hi1;\n+    unsigned int lo0 = mulhilo32(kPhiloxSA, ctr.x, &hi0);\n+    unsigned int lo1 = mulhilo32(kPhiloxSB, ctr.z, &hi1);\n+    uint4 ret = {hi1 ^ ctr.y ^ key.x, lo1, hi0 ^ ctr.w ^ key.y, lo0};\n+    return ret;\n+  }\n+  static const unsigned long kPhilox10A = 0x9E3779B9;\n+  static const unsigned long kPhilox10B = 0xBB67AE85;\n+  static const unsigned long kPhiloxSA = 0xD2511F53;\n+  static const unsigned long kPhiloxSB = 0xCD9E8D57;\n+};\n+\n+typedef philox_engine Philox4_32_10;\n+\n+/*\n+* Distribution implementations adapted from THRandom\n+* Note: These functions are currently here as stubs and may be\n+* removed in the future.
