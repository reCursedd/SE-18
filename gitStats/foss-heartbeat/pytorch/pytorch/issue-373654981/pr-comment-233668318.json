We are \n+* parallelizing this array by partitioning the huge array and assigning \n+* a thread index to each partition. In other words, each seed value \n+* (there are 2^64 possible seed values) gives a sub array of size \n+* 2^128 (each element in that array is a 128 bit number). Reasoning\n+* behind the array being of size 2^128 is, there are 2^64 possible\n+* thread index value and there is an array of size 2^64 for each of\n+* those thread index. Hence 2^64 * 2^64 = 2^128 for each seed value.\n+*\n+* In short, this generator can produce 2^64 (seed values) * 2^128 (number\n+* of elements in an array given by a seed value) = 2^192 values.\n+*\n+* Arguments:\n+* seed:        Seed values could be any number from 0 to 2^64-1.\n+* subsequence: Subsequence is just the cuda thread indexing with:\n+*              - blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x\n+* offset:      The offset variable in PhiloxEngine  decides how many 128-bit \n+*              random numbers to skip (i.e. how many groups of 4, 32-bit numbers to skip)\n+*              and hence really decides the total number of randoms that can be achieved \n+*              for the given subsequence.
