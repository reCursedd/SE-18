In such case it's more efficient to expand the lhs\n+// and use bmm + sum instead of repeating it in memory via concat.\n+\n+// Note [Overlapping trees]\n+// Additionally it wouldn't be too hard to add support for partially overlapping\n+// trees. Right now the it's forbidden in the algorithm (only a single tree will\n+// be allowed), so theoretically we might miss some optimization options, especially\n+// that the rejected tree could be much larger. I didn't implement that because it's\n+// not necessary for the simple RNN cases I saw, so I decided to keep stuff simple.\n+// If we ever get around implementing this, the right solution is probably to fuse\n+// MMs for the common part, and assume it's an input leaf for the outer two parts\n+// (I don't think it's beneficial to recompute, unless the subtree is super small,\n+// but let's not get into such details).\n+\n+// The algorithm we're using is simple. We're iterating through the graph in the\n+// topological order and labeling nodes with TreeTokens. Then, we look for roots of\n+// the trees we formed and fuse them.\n+\n+enum class Side {", "path": "torch/csrc/jit/passes/batch_mm.cpp", "position": null, "original_position": 69, "commit_id": "e1c9b8d84992928c6b74c8bc1ffdee2ad9203c41", "original_commit_id": "33685d861c6bf211a5011d8c761b711f51987e91", "user": {"login": "zdevito", "id": 370202, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjM3MDIwMg==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/370202?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/zdevito", "html_url": "https://github.com/zdevito", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/zdevito/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/zdevito/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/zdevito/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/zdevito/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/zdevito/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/zdevito/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/zdevito/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/zdevito/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/zdevito/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "body": "nit: move this closer to its use.
