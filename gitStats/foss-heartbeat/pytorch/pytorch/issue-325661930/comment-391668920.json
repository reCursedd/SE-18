Yes, we just iterate through local variables and call <code>__str__</code> of them. Well, it looks like it isn't the real problem of crash.<br>\nAlso inside debugger we iterate through all alive threads (returned by <code>threading.enumerate()</code>) and add some attributes to these objects. Does PyTorch do anything special with programs's threads? How do you think, can it lead to crashes in some cases?</p>", "body_text": "@apaszke Thank you for your answer!
