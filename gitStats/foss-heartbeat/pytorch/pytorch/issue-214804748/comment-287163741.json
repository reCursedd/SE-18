Am I missing sth. In the simple convnet example using mnist. There's <code>model = Net()</code> so after training to evaluate my model shouldn't I do <code>model.forward(x)</code> or is it as you've said <code>model(x)</code>  to evaluate the model? I'm a bit confused here.</p>", "body_text": "@soumith Thanks for your answer. Am I missing sth. In the simple convnet example using mnist.
