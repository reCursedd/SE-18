These functions are declared in this file and then folded\n+into the ATen code generation process.\n+\n+## Registering it in `native_functions.yaml`\n+\n+The first step is to write an entry for your function in\n+`native_functions.yaml`.  The format is as follows:\n+\n+```\n+- func: func_name(ArgType arg0[=default], ArgType arg1[=default], ...) -> ReturnType\n+```\n+\n+ArgType(s) are allowed to be simple types understood by ATen\n+(e.g. `Tensor`, `TensorList`, `IntList`, `int64_t`, `double`, ...).\n+`Tensor?` means that the tensor is optional; if it is not passed by\n+the user it defaults to an undefined tensor (if you declare an argument\n+as optional, you must check if it is the case).\n+\n+ReturnType is allowed to be any ArgType or tuple combination of ArgTypes(s),\n+e.g. `(Tensor, Tensor)` defaults are optional and are only allowed to be numbers\n+(e.g. '0' for `int64_t`, '5.0' for `double`)\n+\n+The ATen code generation process will generate a header corresponding\n+to the C++ implementation you will have to write.\n+The C++ function declarations won't match the declaration here because\n+they will undergo the standard ATen C++ transformations, e.g. use of const-ref\n+for non-inplace Tensor arguments (instead of `Tensor` you will\n+take `const Tensor&`).  So after you finish writing your header, we recommend\n+running a build and getting the declaration from `NativeFunctions.h`\n+(find it with `find -name NativeFunctions.h`) to copy paste into your\n+C++ file.\n+\n+The declarations also support the following attributes:\n+\n+```\n+variants: function, method\n+```\n+\n+Controls whether Tensor method (`t.foo()`) or namespace Function (`at::foo()`) is\n+generated as a result of this declaration.
