For nD tensor, I think your math is correct. Thanks a lot for sharing the formula! I will implement this for the case of flipping on a single dim.

Is it going to be a tighter lower bound since flip() requires similar non-continuous memory access?</p>", "body_text": "@ngimel Huge thanks for walking me through CUDA performance details and the formula for flipping!
