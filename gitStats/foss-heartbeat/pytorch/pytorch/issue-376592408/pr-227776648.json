The problem right now is that the C++ extension header `torch/extension.h` does not include the C++ frontend headers from `torch/torch.h`. However, those C++ frontend headers can be convenient. Further, including the C++ frontend main header `torch/torch.h` in a C++ extension currently raises a warning because we want to move people away from exclusively including `torch/torch.h` in extensions (which was the correct thing 6 months ago), since that *used* to be the main C++ extension header but is now the main C++ frontend header. In short: it should be possible to include the C++ frontend functionality from `torch/torch.h`, but without including that header directly because it's deprecated for extensions. \r\n\r\nFor clarification: why is `torch/torch.h` deprecated for extensions? Because for extensions we need to include Python stuff, but for the C++ frontend we don't want this Python stuff. For now the python stuff is included in `torch/torch.h` whenever the header is used from a C++ extension (enabled by a macro passed by `cpp_extensions.py`) to not break existing users, but this should change in the future.\r\n\r\nThe overall fix is simple:\r\n\r\n1. C++ frontend sub-headers move from `torch/torch.h` into `torch/all.h`.\r\n2. `torch/all.h` is included in:\r\n    1. `torch/torch.h`, as is.\r\n    2. `torch/extensions.h`, to now also give C++ extension users this functionality.\r\n\r\n\r\nWith the next release we can then:\r\n1. Remove the Python includes from `torch/torch.h`\r\n2. Move C++-only sub-headers from `all.h` back into `torch.h`\r\n3. Make `extension.h` include `torch.h` and `Python.h`\r\n\r\nThis will then break old C++ extensions that include `torch/torch.h`, since the correct header for C++ extensions is `torch/extension.h`.\r\n\r\nI've also gone ahead and deprecated `torch::CPU` et al. since those are long due to die.\r\n\r\n@ezyang @soumith @apaszke @fmassa ", "created_at": "2018-11-01T22:16:17Z",
