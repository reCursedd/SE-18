Symbols are NOT exported by default on Windows; instead, you have to explicitly\n+   mark a symbol as exported/imported in a header file with `__declspec(dllexport)` /\n+   `__declspec(dllimport)`.  We have codified this pattern into a set of macros\n+   which follow the convention `*_API`, e.g., `AT_API` inside ATen. (Every separate\n+   shared library needs a unique macro name, because symbol visibility is on a per\n+   shraed library basis.)", "path": "CONTRIBUTING.md", "position": null, "original_position": 15, "commit_id": "08cbd0865ddc8fd63ba0f8a94d28405ea4838488", "original_commit_id": "e18e7131e330151979cfb5e44bd711ac949171bb", "user": {"login": "yf225", "id": 4063635, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjQwNjM2MzU=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/4063635?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/yf225", "html_url": "https://github.com/yf225", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yf225/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yf225/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yf225/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yf225/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yf225/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yf225/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yf225/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yf225/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yf225/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "body": "nit: \"shared\"", "created_at": "2018-05-10T01:06:12Z", "updated_at": "2018-11-23T15:43:48Z", "html_url": "https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/pull/7447#discussion_r187216996", "pull_request_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/pytorch/pytorch/pulls/7447", "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR", "_links": {"self": {"href": "https://api.github.com/repos/pytorch/pytorch/pulls/comments/187216996"}, "html": {"href": "https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/pull/7447#discussion_r187216996"}, "pull_request": {"href": "https://api.github.com/repos/pytorch/pytorch/pulls/7447"}}, "body_html": "<p>nit: \"shared\"</p>", "body_text": "nit: \"shared\""}
