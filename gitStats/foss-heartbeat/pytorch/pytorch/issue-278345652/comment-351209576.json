I have two quick questions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>I'm having trouble getting your function to run with random inputs. Could you please post a script that makes use of the beam search, or some more minimal example so that we can aid in debugging?</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>You said that you think there's a memory leak in the gradient computation. How are you computing gradients? The <code>top_k_action</code> function you provided is only a forward pass as far as I can tell (Again, if possible, a reproducing script would help a lot here!).</p>\n</li>\n</ul>", "body_text": "@todpole3 thanks for your response.
