I have solved this problem. Because I am installing caffe2 on a debian OS without sudo right, I cannot use <code>apt install</code> to install nccl. My solution is to install nccl on my own laptop and copied libnccl.2.x.x to this PC. Now it works well. Thank you again!</p>", "body_text": "@pjh5 Thank you for you answer.
