However, I can't use module since I want to define my own backward gradient. And module is mostly for neural network operation, I'm coding a normal function that based on pytorch tensor. And if the problem is happened only with parallel setting, maybe we can use as that way right, in single GPU?</p>", "body_text": "@yjxiong Thank you for your quick response.
