this code easier to read and codemod, this allows us to more freely change TH/THC; for example:\r\ncurrently in the THC random code, the state is casted to THByteTensor*; this happens to work because the macros don't happen to override THByteTensor.\r\n\r\nBut if THByteTensor just becomes an alias of THTensor (which is the plan for a single tensor type), then this no longer works (THByteTensor is now THCTensor!).\r\n\r\nThe whole thing is a bit of a mess previously because you really have to understand which macros and redefined and which aren't.\r\n\r\nWe could also rename the macros that
