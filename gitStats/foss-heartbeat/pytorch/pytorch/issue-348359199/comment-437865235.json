I was trying to modify the transfer learning tutorial (<a href=\"https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/transfer_learning_tutorial.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/transfer_learning_tutorial.html</a>) with the hymenoptera dataset (bees and ants dataset) to make it fit to my project. The problem was that i had 3 classes and the tutorial has 2.  So i found that you have to define the number of outputs from the fully connected network (the output layer). So the only thing i had to do was changing \"model_ft.fc = nn.Linear(num_ftrs, 2)\" to \"model_ft.fc = nn.Linear(num_ftrs, 3)\". Hope it helps somebody :)</p>", "body_text": "I kind of had the same problem.
