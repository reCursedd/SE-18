The biggest challenge here I think is to define what it means to have a \"batch\" of sparse tensors. Our sparse tensors have sparse dimensions and dense dimensions; but the sparse dimensions always come before the dense dimensions. Ideally we'd like the batch dimension (or dimensions) to be dense and at the beginning of the tensor, like elsewhere in PyTorch, but I'm not sure if our current sparse tensor api lets us do this.</p>", "body_text": "@atulkum Let me know if you have any specific questions.
