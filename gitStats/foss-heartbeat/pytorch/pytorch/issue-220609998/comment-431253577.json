But I still don't quite understand how this can happen. Could you post some more details? Things I am interested to know are PyTorch version used, and whether this is a single process or multiprocess training and, if the latter, whether CUDA context is created in each process. Concretely, this may include: whether distributed training is used, whehter DataLoader workers are used, whether the dataset return CUDA tensors, etc.</p>", "body_text": "@Spandan-Madan Hey, I know we talked a bit on forum.
